We are young, energetic, adventurous, easy going and polite.  We are excited to be traveling to Europe this summer for the first time and crave to experience all that we can while here.  

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college, lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by, John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation (hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills!).  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area.  We like to go out in the evenings, have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing.  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets.  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States. We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are, though we know that we can't tell everything in this little description.  We have many hobbies and interests and hope to pick up more on our travels, if you are curious or would like to know more about us, Please Please ask us, we are more than willing to share!

Thank you for takig the time to read about us, we hope to meet you in the future!

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.

We are a newly married couple with a healthy curiosity for travel and culture. For our honeymoon we backpacked around the world in 10 unforgettable months. We came back to the states to attend Graduate School at the UW and put down roots here in gorgeous Seattle. I, Yedida, am originally from Portland, OR and Vincent is from Eastern WA, so we know the Pacific NW like the back of our hand. 

We enjoy cooking, being outdoors, exercising, reading and dancing (well, that's just me!). Travel remains our number one love. I remain loosely connected to the international community through my work as an Italian instructor. 

We are very open people who are used to travel, meeting new people and sharing community space. During our honeymoon we utilized both (website hidden) and WWOOF (World Wide Organization of Organic Farming) to gain a deeper perspective of the countries we were visiting. Nevertheless, we absolutely respect privacy and the need for quiet or alone time. We will be happy to let you do your own thing if that's your preference, but we will be equally happy to share the communal spaces in our home. 

We have a roommate, Kevin, who occupies the basement floor of the house. Kevin is an accomplished pastry chef and works a lot in the summer. You will catch him in the kitchen cooking up all sorts of yummy treats for us!

I've traveled extensively to England, Germany, France, Italy, India, Thailand, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, Hawaii, Ukraine, and Israel.

Merlock L.L.C. is a web hosting and I.T. consulting business that builds customized software for businesses to enhance productivity. We are also innovators of green energy equipment such as devices that recycle used cooking oil into cost effective vehicle fuel.

My dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. Specifically a program that will send doctors from the US to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick. I believe that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status. 

While in college I owned a company that produced raves and concerts near San Francisco. While I don't produce raves anymore, I still run (website hidden) on the side, which sells music. 

I joke around a lot and act like a kid when I'm around cute little pets. I love plants and growing plants. If I get an avocado (yum!) I plant the seed. 

One indicator of successful people is their ability to choose a greater reward that takes longer to achieve, versus an inferior reward that takes less time. I typically wait the longer period for the greater reward.

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too.

I was born in Germany and came to California when I was very young.  You might say that I came on a whim, with hardly an idea what I was getting into.  But it all worked out beautifully.

Seattle, Washington, USA                   Member since October 2013.

Thanks for checking us out for your visit to Seattle. We would like to be your local hosts while you are here.

Barbara is a native of Austria and speaks German as well as English.  Michael is from Miami and speaks Spanish, Portuguese and some Italian.  We both had careers in the travel industry and were able to travel, study, live and work in many places around the world. In 1980, we chose Seattle as our favorite place to live, especially on Queen Anne. 

Now that we are both retired from the full time working world we have found many interesting and pleasurable activities, in addition to hosting of course that fill our time. 

These include cooking (inspired by Barbara's time as a personal chef), in-city and in-nature walking, spending quality time with our family and friends, being active grandparents, appreciating Seattle's world class arts scene (especially opera, ballet, theater & gallery arts) just to name a few. 

We are both very interested in the study of herbs and essential oils (aroma therapy). In addition, Barbara continues on as a licensed yoga therapist and teaches yoga.

Michael is involved in the growing ""movement for health"" scene. He is also developing a series of books for children (and the child in all of us) around the theme of giraffes.

Last but not least is Sammy, our 5 year old beagle. He is friendly and adorable. He helps both of us to be in the moment and connected to the outdoors as we walk through the different neighborhoods on Queen Anne. And he
doesn't bark or bay!!!

Our story: we lifted this house 10 years ago and put a brand new, legal accessory dwelling unit (apartment) under it.

We have owned our 1904 Victorian cottage in central Seattle since 1997. We love Seattle and want to share our knowledge of the city with visitors. We love to entertain, so airbnb was a perfect ""marriage""so to speak. 

We love to travel. I have been to 44 of the 50 states, Mexico, Canada, Europe (Italy, UK, France, Switzerland, Spain, The Netherlands, and Russia), and SE Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, & Bali). We would love to travel to South America, Australia, New Zealand, Greece, Turkey, Germany & Eastern Europe. We also like road trips in the US. We did a 4,000 mile road trip to Indiana and back in 2011. We did one in the Southeast (Charleston, Savannah, Asheville, Raleigh, and Gatlinburg) last year. Our next one will be to southern Utah and the many beautiful national parks.

Other than travel I am passionate about architecture, sustainable development, urban planning, design, maps, social and economic justice, All Pilgrims Christian Church, Community Lunch/Supper (serving meals to homeless and hungry on Capitol Hill), Plan USA (we sponsor a child in Vietnam through this charity that is fantastic!). I could go on and on...

We love our many chef owned restaurants, the green spaces, proximity to the City Center, the many Universities and beaches all surrounded by white snow capped mountains. Seattle has more places to eat breakfast than most major cities twice our size and we have 2 Happy Hours in Seattle. The usual afternoon/early evening and the late 10pm-1am, great after a show or concert.  We are a professional couple that enjoys reading, meeting new people, avid music fans and of course traveling. I have been a guest at many other Airbnb homes and enjoyed meeting new people and relating to a neighborhood instead of a hotel lobby. When we decided to become hosts our goal was to provide both the comfort and amenities of an upscale hotel and the feel of a home in an amazing neighborhood. We are close to everything with enough distance from the busy downtown corridor that finding a quiet park or sidewalk restaurant you can walk to from the studio lends the opportunity for a variety of memorable experiences.

I enjoy Airbnb because it gives me a chance to hang out with travellers and give other travellers a nice place to crash here while in town thats not a hostel or hotel. :) no matter if we meet or not <3 I hope you enjoy your stay here in Seattle.

My town home is newly constructed and in the Capital Hill area of Seattle. In my opinion Capital Hill is the best place in all of Seattle to get the truest feel of what the city is all about. I will be your attentive host throughout your stay. The home has two Airbnb bedrooms, both on the lower floors of my home which share a private rear entrance of their own and a bathroom. The upper room may also use the front door entrance for access to their room. The modern decor fits beautifully with the neighborhood and the neighbors are all very polite.

My home is located just one block from Seattle University and is within a 5 minute walk to the trendiest restaurants, cocktail bars, and clubs Capital Hill has to offer. Seattle is an extremely walkable city and the home is also within a 25-30 minute walk to Downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market. The home is tucked away on a quiet street so if you want to escape from the hustle and bustle of downtown and Capital Hills (Pike and Pine triangle) just head on over and relax after a long day of sight seeing, shopping, or after a late night out.

I am an outdoorsy guy (snowboard in winters, hike, backpack, and boulder in the summers/fall) who dreams of having his own cabin, but loves everything the city has to offer too much to ever be able to live full-time in the country.

I studied music in college--my first love-- and am now a policy/political wonk.   In my spare time I also homebrew, make homecrafted bitters and licquers, cook, and garden.   Also enjoy a good book, a strong cup of coffee, the arts, video gaming, baseball and American football and other sports.  

Cities I've lived:  Seattle, WA; Boston, MA; Washington, D.C.; Indianapolis, IN, Manhattan, KS; Sheboygan, WI; Kingston-upon-Hull, UK; Nottingham, UK.
