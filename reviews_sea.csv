40813543,7202016,8/2/2015,33671805,"Close to Seattle Center and all it has to offer - ballet, theater, museum, Space Needle, restaurants of all ilk just blocks away, and the Metropolitan (probably the coolest grocer you'll ever find). Easy to find and Kelly was warm, welcoming, and really interesting to talk to. "

CHEERS"
47783346,7202016,9/21/2015,249583,"Kelly's place is conveniently located on a quiet street in Lower Queen Anne which is an easy walk or bus/cab ride to Belltown and Downtown in addition to being a booming neighborhood in its own right. Alas, I was visiting my job and old friends in Seattle so my schedule was completely full and I barely got to meet Kelly. Which is too bad, she seemed great!"

Clean Linen and Towels were provided and the air mattress was superb. 
The Neighbourhood is practical with a lot of restaurants and cafes around. Downtown is reachable by foot (30 min) or bus (10 min).
Kelly was a fantastic host, although I was working most of the time, so I haven't had time to talk much to her. "

We only got to meet her for a moment one evening because of our varied schedule, but she was warm and welcoming to us.
Her place is also in good walking distance to City Center!  Lots to do right around there!
We would recommend her place to others who are traveling to Seattle!"

58268184,7202016,1/2/2016,41297839,Kelly was an amazing host who made the stay very pleasurable. Her location is ideal for anyone visiting Seattle. Highly recommended
20798623,3946674,10/5/2014,9313038,"Despite our late booking request, Rachel & Jon were very responsive and helpful over email. It was a great place to stay - the location was ideal, the house was clean, well-furnished, the room was cozy, and the cat made good company.

The house is conveniently located, spacious, and beautiful. The room has space for luggages or coats in a big closet. You are given a spare key, so you're free to go in and out.
We have felt really confortable with our hosts and really recommand this house as a place to stay if you're going to Seattle."

Would definitely sleep there again!"
23463915,3946674,12/1/2014,20706964,"Super cozy home. Located near some good restaurants and bars. The only time we really spent at the house was while we were sleeping because we were busy sightseeing on our only day in Seattle, but we would love to stay there again. The cat was an added bonus! 
The only downside was that their room was right next to ours so we felt like we needed to be extra quiet. We also had to wake up very early and we felt bad that Jon and Rachel's room was right next to ours, but I'm sure they're used to it! 
Another bonus was that they had wonderful looking bread and beverages available for us in the morning, but unfortunately we didn't have time to enjoy them! "
23709531,3946674,12/8/2014,23941301,"Cute house, and Rachel and Jon were super nice hosts.  Very prompt communication, clean, comfortable rooms, simple and relaxing decor. Thanks guys!"

Everything consistent with the description and Rachel has provided useful information to get around the area. 
It takes a bit more than expected to walk to the downtown though. "

They gave us valuable tips to explore Seattle and even invited us to go to a concert with them - a super experience! The room and the bed provided enough space for two, very comfortable furthermore. The bathroom and the kitchen were clean and we could find everything we needed. All in all a wonderful stay, there was nothing to complain about at all!"
25275185,3946674,1/11/2015,11109842,"What a great stay at Rachel and Jon's! They were accommodating hosts and we felt instantly at ease in their home. They were very kind letting our group of four stay at their home, and very flexible with check-in and check-out times.

27110794,3946674,2/25/2015,4920230,"It was very easy to get in touch with Rachel to book a space in her beautiful home. She was a very gracious host who shared her morning coffee with us while she was getting ready for work. Our room was very cozy and the rest of the house is open & beautifully decorated - if we didn't have other plans it would have been easy to lounge there all day, especially with their friendly kitty! The farmhouse is located in a great neighborhood that is quite easy to access the city - because the weather was so wonderful during our stay, my friend & I walked to the downtown waterfront which only took about 35 minutes. I would highly recommend staying here - I will again when I return to Seattle."
27182900,3946674,2/27/2015,3002880,"Rachel and Jon's home is beautiful and inspiring! We were only there for a brief time but they made us feel at home. And Brigitte, the cat, is the friendliest cat I've ever met. 

The location is very convenient, barely 2 miles from downtown and Capitol Hill. 

Also, You'll have fun browsing through some of the interesting art + doodads around the house"
28291295,3946674,3/21/2015,28621214,"John and Rachel were great hosts. We arrived, opened the lock box, and found our room with no trouble. The neighborhood was quiet but Capitol Hill restaurants and bars were easily accessible. Coffee, fruit, and nuts were left in the kitchen for guests and were greatly appreciated. For a quiet night in Seattle, the Farmhouse is a great option with a very sweet cat!"
28433477,3946674,3/23/2015,21176280,"Rachel and Jon were very friendly and flexible. Rachel had baked us some homemade cookies that tasted fantastic after a 7 hr flight to Seattle. Thank you!! The room was great and spot on with the description. There was free wifi and a list of recommended spots to check out while in Seattle. Very clean house and safe neighborhood. 

Their cat is very friendly as well! Five star cat ^_^  

Rachel was very flexible about check out time. It helped us a lot since our flight wasn't until later that night. 

The location is great! near the downtown area.  I highly recommend this place.  "
28534479,3946674,3/25/2015,26018276,"Rachel was a gracious host and, though we met her only shortly, she was very friendly. We slept comfortably in the Corner room, that is simply furnished and a bit chilly at night, but also quite private and quiet. They offer complimentary fruit, nuts and drinks for breakfast, which was very nice, especially since they had a dairy-free alternative (delicious hazelnut milk) for lactose-intolerant people like me. "
28843895,3946674,3/30/2015,29870942,"I felt very welcome at Rachel & Jon's house, even though I wasn't able to check in until late. House matched the description, clean and comfortable room, and a very nice cat."

30773722,3946674,4/27/2015,3474876,Jon & Rachel were both awesome host and people to meet as well as their sweet kitty.

Enjoyed my stay in Seattle. Thank yoU!!
31599041,3946674,5/7/2015,15811536,Rachel and Jon were really great and their place is clean and comfy. And their cat is so friendly! Good location and great hosts. Absolutely recommend. 
31748548,3946674,5/9/2015,32286824,"Rachel and Jon were awesome! I felt welcomed the second I stepped foot in their home. It was almost like I was staying with friends of my own. I had never been to Seattle before, but the insight they gave me about what there is to experience around the city helped shaped my vacation for the best. 

As far as the house itself -- it was beautiful, clean, filled with great art and lush plants.. Just like the photos! The only evidence of their cat was Brigitte herself. There wasn't any pet odor or hair to be found. The house has amazing natural lighting as well. But not to worry, the bedroom has a very heavy curtain for blocking out the morning sun for sleeping in as long as you please. The comfy bed was a great thing to come back to each night after a long day of exploring. Located in the Central District (literally central to everything), I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go and felt very safe doing so. 

They have set the bar extremely high for any future Airbnb experiences. I will definitely try to book with Rachel and Jon the next time I travel to Seattle, and will recommend their listing to everyone I know! "

35123521,3946674,6/15/2015,32870799,"Rachel was a great host and the room/house was great.  While we were out exploring most of our time there, we felt right at home and at ease where we were staying. 

The neighborhood is just a mile walk (or cheap Uber ride) from downtown Seattle and the same for Capitol Hill area. 

If cats are an issue - don't worry.   I can be sometimes sensitive to cat hair - but you would never know there was a cat in the house.  But she is super sweet but also not in the way if you don't want her to be - but she does like a good petting :)"
35398735,3946674,6/18/2015,33943549,"They were really great!  We got in very late because of a delayed flight, but they didn't mind one bit.  They were both very friendly and really cool to talk to.  We were only there one night on our way up to B.C. but I would have loved to stay with them longer.  Awesome house in a great neighborhood.  Plus, they have a really dope cat.  Highly recommend.  "
35579217,3946674,6/20/2015,1928003,"I had a great experience staying at the Farmhouse! Rachel and Jon (and the kitty) were incredibly sweet and accommodating. They let me drop my bags off several hours early so I could make the most of my day exploring Seattle. It was so nice to be able to come and go as I pleased. The house was safe, clean, and down right adorable. As my first Airbnb experience, the bar has been set pretty high!"
37201302,3946674,7/5/2015,26170953,"Rachel made us feel totally welcome.  She was in close contact with me on the day of our arrival.  Their home is exceptionally beautiful, and our bed was very comfy.  She did everything possible to keep the place cool (in 95 degree heat!) and offered great suggestions for food and fun in Seattle.  Oh yeah, and the cat was also very cuddly and lovable!"
37338415,3946674,7/6/2015,15967204,"Rachel and Jon's house is a very nice classic Seattle house in a great location. We were there in the middle of a heat wave but the house still kept cool, even though it was 95+ out we had no trouble even napping midday in our comfy room. They left treats and snack out and had a very friendly cat that we enjoyed napping with. We missed paths on the way in but met up on the way out and lo and behold we knew each other from high school! We had a great time sipping coffee and catching up and will definitely check back in for future Seattle trips."
38295437,3946674,7/14/2015,30544873,"Rachel & Jon were incredible hosts! They were both very friendly, open, easy going and their hospitality was far more than I could have ever hoped for. They both offered tips of where to go, what to do, where to shop and how to find what I was looking for. They even shared the fruits of their labour blueberry picking, and helped me make coffee in the morning. It made my first weekend of school that much more enjoyable knowing I was returning to somewhere that felt like home."
39176070,3946674,7/21/2015,34858362,"This was my very first stay at an Airbnb and it was lovely.  I chose the Corner Room at the Farmhouse because of its proximity to my daughter's apartment.  Rachel & John were very nice and made me feel welcome in their home.  The bed was extremely comfortable, so I slept great, and I learned how to use the French Press to make coffee.  The house is clean and sunny in a nice neighborhood. 
I will definitely stay at The Corner Room again the next time I visit.
"
57111968,3946674,12/22/2015,37096823,"Rachel and Job were great hosts. Their home was not only clean and welcoming, but very beautiful. In terms of location they're nestled between downtown and Capitol Hill so commuting was relatively easy (note: we relied on cabs and Lyfts). To top it all off they have an adorable cat Brigit who was utterly delightful to spend time with. 

Would recommend/stay again!"
44472406,7833113,8/26/2015,34123551,"Kelli was an amazing host and immediately opened her hospitality to my boyfriend and I. She welcomed us into her apartment and gave us the run down on Seattle. She even went out of her way and provided for us a huge and informative lists of many of the highlights of Seattle. My boyfriend and I really wanted to experience the coffee, beer, and food scene of Seattle, and Kelli covered it all perfectly!

The location was perfect and ideal for first timers in Seattle. Pike Place and the Seattle Center  (Space Needle and Chihuly) were just a short walk away.  Fremont was also a slightly longer walk north from Kelli's. Lastly, Kerri Park where you can receive one of the best views of the Seattle skyline was also very close!

Overall Kelli was a phenomenal host and I highly recommend her for anyone visiting Emerald City!"
45156782,7833113,8/31/2015,13316300,"First and foremost Kelli went out of her way to install a keybox to make this whole trip way more convenient. It's apparent she cares about those she hosts.

When we arrived the apartment was clean and comfy. We found our cozy bedroom to be very accommodating. My wife and I had no problems sleeping with the futon that was folded out. It was surprisingly comfortable. Kelli provided pillows, towels, and everything we needed for the night. The room's decoration was really cool. 

The neighborhood was great and we didn't feel like we needed to go far for anything we needed. Attending PAX was a breeze.

When we finally met Kelli on the final morning she was warm and welcoming. We got to meet her dog who is a little bundle of love. I have no reservations about staying with Kelli again."
45704944,7833113,9/5/2015,7354543,Convenient location close to Music Museum. Easy to find. Nice and tidy.  Host gave us a lot of good suggestions of vegetarian places to eat and punk bars. Turns out we had lots in common.

It was a great location and easy to get around.   She has a kitten and a dog which were adorable. After staying at Kelli's for 10 days, I really felt comfortable and relaxed.  I really enjoyed my visit to Seattle. Thanks!  Joe Sparks"
49817108,7833113,10/6/2015,2618477,"Kelli was a great host. Nice, very helpful - an overall awesome lady! We were a little late getting in, no problem. Thanks for the record shop and restaurant recommendations!

The apartment was very clean and decorated beautifully. An easy walk to Belltown and beyond, we barely used the car.

Fantastic, highly recommended, thank you!"
50456359,7833113,10/12/2015,9151574,"This listing was perfect for our stay in Seattle. We were walking distance from the Space Needle as well as a ton of restaurants, coffee shops and bars (which Kelli had great suggestions for). The room looks exactly like it did in the pictures, if we are ever in Seattle again, we would stay here again no question."
51903847,7833113,10/25/2015,42635470,"Kelli was an absolutely wonderful host!! Kelli went out of her way to make sure we knew how to make the most of our stay in Seattle. If we ever needed directions, a restaurant suggestion, or any other advice, Kelli was more than willing to help, and was never more than a text or call away. Plus, Kelli had a map, and newspapers and lists of all the places to go to in Seattle ready for us as soon as we arrived. The location of Kelli's home is amazing! Just a few minutes walk away from major attractions, and steps away from bus lines. Walking distance to excellent restaurants. We loved our beautiful and very comfortable room. We slept very well, and we had no privacy issues at all. Kelli keeps her home impeccably clean and dust-free, which I really appreciated as an asthmatic. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time in Seattle thanks to Kelli and her beautiful home! And her doggy, Desi, was super cute and sweet. It was very hard to leave Seattle after having such a great time. Thank you so much Kelli!"

She was very helpful, she provided advice about restaurants and places to visit. We would definitely stay at Kelli's again if we were in town again. "
55361093,7833113,12/1/2015,2830204,"Great room, great location and great host. The room is clean and private, the rest of the house is also very clean and Kelli is accomodating when sharing space (lounge room, kitchen and bathroom). The location is very close to a major shopping centre and the space needle (walking distance) also close to buses to downtown. Kelli knows her city well and is there to help you enjoy it- she had lots of helpful hints and tips.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend. "
55916043,7833113,12/7/2015,7560156,"Kelli was an amazing host and made my first Seattle experience very memorable! The location couldn't have been better -- it's only a few blocks away from the iconic Space Needle and a slew of cultural hubs. There are fantastic restaurants steps away from the apartment and Kelli has recommendation dishes for all of them. In addition, there are multiple bus stops just around the corner to bring you to farther places for sightseeing. For example, the University of Washington and Arboretum was about 40 minutes away. 

Kelli is just the sweetest, which is further proven by the scrumptious freshly baked cookies she offered me during my stay. Also, she has an adorable kitten who will surely melt your heart! When I accidentally left my charger after boarding the plane, she even mailed it back to me. Couldn't have asked for a better host <3
"
57119975,7833113,12/22/2015,28662643,"Kelli is such an awesome host. From the moment we booked with her she was so helpful in answering questions and giving suggestions. She was there to meet us and had all sorts of maps/guides to help out. She also pays attention to details with the chocolates/mints in the room to the fridge space provided and even tea. 

The place is an old building but in such a terrific area - easily you can walk to some of the major sights (ex. Space Needle, Key Arena, the monorail, etc). The room & bed were comfortable and true to the pictures. There was wifi and a tv for you to kick back and relax on the couch with. So if you want a place to have a nice hot shower and a good sleep after a long day out, this is a great place for you. 

If you're lucky enough you'll also get to meet Charlie, who was such a friendly and lovable kitten - and we're normally not even cat people! :) "
47014896,8308353,9/14/2015,1964916,"Courtney was so welcoming, I immediately felt at home.  The cats ranged from very friendly to friendly to indifferent.  The second-floor room was beautiful, with lots of light, good views, and the bed was great.  The house is in easy walking distance of Gas Works Park (I was attending a wedding there) and all that Stone Way has to offer.

I highly recommend staying here!"

All over we had a wonderful time and would definetly stay again.

I had a great stay. They're both warm, welcoming people that go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The house is located in a residential neighborhood (quiet & safe), but not too far from downtown Seattle (20 min by bus or so?), the U district, Ballard, Wallingford... Especially the last two are nice if you're looking to a nice place to have lunch/dinner. I would definitely recommend staying with Adam & Courtney!  "
23284049,4277026,11/27/2014,12849861,"Philip was a great host! He made us a map of the area with a curated selection of personal favourites. Every place we tried at his recommendation was sublime. We jammed together and went to a few shows. It felt like visiting an old friend more than just your average impersonal AirBnB experience. The room was nice, a little sparse maybe but we weren't spending a huge amount of time there. the location was one of the best parts as there are a ton of great spots within 2 blocks. I'll definitely be staying again next time I hit up Seattle."
25402633,4277026,1/14/2015,25892167,"My girlfriend and I stayed with Philip for two nights. It felt like staying with a real roommate and not like staying at a hotel. It was easy to connect with Philip through our love of music and we had some interesting conversations. So if you're looking for a place to feel like being home with a friend and not just only stay there to spend your nights I would highly recommend to stay with him. The neighbourhood (capitol hill) is cool too, there are a lot of good bars serving craft beer and some really good coffee shops."

44469361,7735100,8/26/2015,19864124,"This room was PERFECT for me and fit my needs exactly. It's nicer than the hotel rooms I stayed in during other legs of the trip and definitely fit the budget better. It's a bedroom in a 3-bedroom apartment duplex. Rumor has it that someone lives in at least one of the other rooms, but I didn't see them during the two nights I stayed here. The bathroom is attached to the bedroom, so that's convenient. And this place is located in a very cool neighborhood within walking distance from tons of great spots. I even walked all the way to Pike Place Market from Roger's place and it was a breeze. 

My only warning is that there isn't a lock on the door to the bedroom. I wasn't concerned about this but others might be. I'm traveling solo and don't have anything super valuable sitting around the room, but keep that in mind. 

All in all, the place is rad and Roger lives next door and works 5 minutes away so he's nearby in the event of any major problems. "

Miesha is a wonderful host.  She is helpful and communicative and her home is comfortable. When I arrived, she made sure that the furniture in the room included what I needed for my stay.  She switched out a chair and added a desk which I have used quit a bit.  She worked with me to extend my stay and was very accommodating of my ongoing search.  Plus, she keeps plenty of coffee on hand which has kept me going on even the rainiest of days. I can't imagine finding a better place to stay while starting out my life in Seattle!  I highly recommend this room."

The neighborhood is safe and she is near an excellent grocery store, coffee shops and bus stop. We were in town to do a class and so had to leave early each morning. As mentioned, this listing has a shared bathroom but at the time of our stay there were 5 of us trying to get ready in one bathroom all at the same time to all leave by 7am. I guess we just assumed it would be us and her using it only.Farah did her best to schedule the times that each person could use the bathroom. I would take into consideration your trip and daily bathroom time use when booking this listing. With that said, you cant beat the price and value for the seattle area."

A lovely neighborhood with restaurants etc within easy walking distance. Ben and Farah are personable and engaging, offered great suggestions for restaurants, tho' provided privacy and non-intrusion also as needed.
The only bathroom is a shared one with the hosts, but it really wasn't a problem as only slight scheduling communications took care of it.
I will return here again when in the area, and would recommend this space to friends who might travel there as well.
Thanks for a great first experience!"

We were pretty exhausted after a day of driving and exploring Seattle so we went into our room and slept pretty quickly. It was only 8:30 or so when we decided to go to bed, but the house was very silent even though it was so early, so we really appreciated that!

I forgot a towel and she supplied me one.   I did not arrive until the evening  and went to bed early and woke up early, so I did not have much contact with them. The neighborhood is a very quite.

15402820,2934389,7/8/2014,7682798,"This was my first experience with AirBnB, and I have to admit I was a little nervous. But, Bonnie was a delight and made me feel comfortable and very much at home.  

Prior to arriving in Seattle, Bonnie was extremely attentive to my emails and answered all of my questions immediately. We quickly establish great lines of communication which made me feel very much at ease. 

Upon arrival, she was very flexible with our check-in time and greeted my boys and I at our car.  Once in the home, she was very thorough with her tour, and left us with a welcome letter, and details to some important responsibilities.  I felt very comfortable chatting with her and felt that she and I could very easily hit it off as friends. 

It was obvious that Bonnie spent a lot of time thinking of ways to make us feel at home. Age appropriate toys were left out for my boys, a bowl of fruit was filled for us to enjoy, beautiful accents of fresh flowers and plants filled the space, and a wonderful selection of LP's were at our finger tips, just to name a few. The place was every bit as beautiful and inviting as the photos, and the energy of the home was so relaxing. 

Bonnie's attentive and thoughtful hospitality has set a high bar. I hope that other hosts are just as welcoming as she was.  She and her Urban Tree-house will be first on our list for our next trip up to the PNW.  "
17998079,2934389,8/20/2014,10849699,"Serene apartment, exactly as described.  Bonnie was the perfect hostess who didn't miss a detail.  My family stayed for 6 weeks in the summer, and it was a perfect home away from home.   very convenient to parks, buses, shopping, etc.  Note there is no TV, but grab a book and pot of tea, coffee, listen to music, play piano, and enjoy Seattle."

The apartment was exactly as pictured and described, but with extra hospitality. This feels like a Bohemian artists loft and is so comfortable and charming. You do not feel like you will break anything or can't touch and all the decorator and guest touches are just perfect! I hope Bonnie will welcome me back as this location is perfect for my office which is 1 mi away at Green Lake. The freeway access is easy and it's a nice neighborhood. And Thank You, Bonnie, for the little treats you left for us--especially coffee :)"
37470618,2934389,7/7/2015,18898726,"Check-in was a breeze. Bonnie was very responsive and had suggestions of things to do in Seattle over a holiday weekend. The space was cozy, and it was a very welcoming space for a family with children. There is a great coffee shop across the street, as well as a park within walking distance.

We stayed at the apartment during a Seattle heat-wave, so the older building ended up being a little stuffy without A/C. Fans and open windows helped during the nights."

Overall we enjoyed our stay."
40891244,2934389,8/3/2015,2631519,"Bonnie's place was the perfect base from which to explore Seattle. Having a 10-year-old in tow, it was really nice to have the huge park next door. You're only about 10 minutes from downtown Seattle, but the Maple Leaf neighborhood offers plenty of dining options if you don't want to be bothered with making the trek. The place was spacious, bright and clean with plenty of room for our family of 3. I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about not having a TV, but we whiled away our downtime listening to records or surfing the Internet via w-fi. So I guess you could say no complaints! Overall, a great AirBnB experience."

If you're considering staying here, reserve it now before it's too late!  You won't find a cuter, more clean place in West Seattle, or nicer more considerate hosts.

My wife and I arrived in Seattle late, and Hamlin and his wife Amy were gracious enough to stay up and welcome us when we arrived at midnight.  There is plenty of street parting, and their condo is nestled between other condos across a grassy well groomed walkway.   

The house itself is so charming and immaculately decorated and clean.  We were there for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and they had even gotten us a bottle of wine!  So thoughtful! 

The room is downstairs, and again is very clean and welcoming.  We had access to a washroom on the main floor, and a full bathroom upstairs which has to be the absolutely cleanest bathroom I have ever seen in a house ever.  

Depending on the day, you may be woken up by the padding feet of their two adorable kids, who were so cute and well-behaved, (at least when we were around =).  

Hamlin and his wife Amy were so considerate, and we had no trouble at all coming in and our of the house at different times of the day, and they respected our privacy to the utmost. 

All in all, an great experience.

Although we were on the go 90% of our trip, they were eager and willing to provide us with amazing suggestions, travel tips and even took time out to research bus information for us. The little things that can make city traveling a little tricky, were a breeze thanks to their assistance and advice.  Their home is conveniently located near a bus stop that makes it easy to get to and from the city, and neighborhood is close to the beach, and in a quiet safe setting.  We also had the need for street parking and found a close by spot for our van/trailer rig everyday when we returned. 

Their kids made the stay especially enjoyable and fun. They are full of energy and life, but they were also very respectful of our space and we never felt like our privacy was compromised. The bedroom where we stayed was downstairs providing us a quiet nook to rest in after our long city days. Hamlin and Amy even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy while we were there and made us feel like friends, not just passing through! 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay with the Ham Fam again! "

Their home was beautiful, clean, and definitely cozy! The neighborhood was quiet, welcoming, and very cute. The area is nestled right behind a library with the most convenient bus stop that takes you straight downtown.

Our trip in Seattle was extremely enjoyable and we could attribute a good slice of that to having such awesome hosts and a beautiful, convenient place to stay at."

For most of the time we had the pleasure to deal with Amy. She is wonderful with kids. As we were travelling with our one year old daughter, staying at tha HamFam was perfekt for us. They even could provide us with a ""baby-bed"".
Even before our arrival they've been very helpful giving us some different options of how to get to their place.
The room and the entire house were very clean and located in a good neighborhood. Just a 20 Minute busride to downtown. The bus stop is close by.

Before we arrived in Seattle he sent us directions on how to get to his apartment, and he waited for us downstairs, so it was very easy for us to find the building. As we stepped into the apartment we felt quickly like at home. This is a cozy apartment, clean and with good taste in decorations. Justin offered some fruit, beagles and orange juice, which were very much appreciated. The apartment itself is awesome and you will feel like you don't want to go out. We had planned to eat out every day, but in the end we bought some food at the nearby QFC and cooked at home several times. I particularly enjoyed the projector. If you have a netflix account you can enjoy movies in a home theater setting.  Neighborhood was also great, 5 minutes walking distance from many happening places, stores and bars, and 15 minutes (or less) walking to the Pike Market Place. I definitely recommend this Justin's apartment for a short of long stay in Seattle.  "

Justin was very accommodating especially when my travel plans changed at the last minute. He provided toiletries as well as bagels, fruit and juice for breakfast. Overall a wonderful experience, would recommend and also stay again."
24854866,4494948,1/3/2015,8291197,"The apartment was great. The location was fabulous: easy walking distance to downtown, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union etc. Apartment was roomy, extremely clean and has an awesome view of Mt Rainer. Kitchen was well appointed, and there is a big projector TV. No complaints at all. 5 stars.

The one slight negative was parking: its a bit difficult/pricey to park. This is really nothing to do with the apartment, just First Hill."
25210780,4494948,1/9/2015,20037108,"Great stay!  The apartment is really nice, comfortable, and quiet, with everything I needed. I really appreciated the bagels, orange juice and bananas; also the fast internet, shower supplies, and free laundry facilities. Thanks for the helpful instructions for arriving from the airport. Easy walk (~10 min) from light rail and the conference center; even closer to restaurants and coffee shops. Thank you, Justin!"

Justin left very detailed instructions on how to get in and once in,  we discovered he left us a fresh bag of bagels/cream cheese/ orange juice.  The place was prestine condition and the small touches presented a true bnb experience.  If we are ever in Seattle,  we would definately stay at Justins again!"

His place is about 10 minutes' walk from downtown, and it is clean, smart and well equipped. The bagels, orange juice and bananas kept me going for most of my stay! Couldn't imagine a better place to stay - I'd definitely recommend it and would stay there again. Thanks for a great stay!"
29366732,4494948,4/6/2015,10827446,"Justin's apartment felt like nothing short of a home-away-from-home while I stayed there for my business trip to Seattle. As a roomy 1-BR, it's more than enough space for a solo traveler, though I'm sure a couple would feel plenty comfortable as well. The furniture is classy and cozy, the bed is fantastic, kitchen is beautiful, and the home theater HD projector is awesome for throwing a movie up on the wall in what feels like your private movie theater.

To top it off, Justin was an ideal host. Before I arrived, he was extremely detailed and timely in his responses to my questions about parking options, wireless internet, etc. And once I arrived, I was welcomed with fresh bagels & cream cheese, fresh fruit and OJ. Plus, he had a clear home essentials instruction sheet, along with a Seattle tourism guide, both printed out and waiting for me on the kitchen counter. Really made it feel like a classic B&B experience.

All in all, a true 5-star property with a 5-star host."
30067225,4494948,4/17/2015,24674650,"I really had a good time in Seattle which Justin's condo is one of the big reasons for that. It was a perfect home away from home for us. The room was well-equipped, clean, beautiful and in a great location just like the description and pictures. It takes very short time to walk to downtown and if you need a bus, the bus stop is just a few steps away from the building. There are drug store, convenient store, restaurants and fast food shops nearby. Justin is a great host, being kind and flexible with us. I really recommend this place to everyone coming to Seattle! Thanks to Justin again for such a nice place. "
30921949,4494948,4/29/2015,529153,"We can tell Justin is a considerate person from his way of welcome - fruit, begal, OJ, drinking water, well equipped kitchen, a clear map of Seattle on the wall and even a Seattle landmark chocolate bar.  You'll feel like you're at home.  
Justin's apartment located in a quiet area that surrounded by some nice apartments, two pretty historical houses and plenty of green.  You can walk esaily to downtown or take bus #2 that is one block away to Kerry Park of Queen Ann at where you'll have fabulous view of downtown Seattle especially the Space Needle."
31870328,4494948,5/11/2015,18425414,"Justin's apartment was the perfect base for our short stay in Seattle. Perched on the top of First Hill, it is easy walking distance to a local shopping strip on Broadway and to downtown/the waterfront (if you don't mind a bit of a steep walk- we did see busses whiz by too). The place itself was very comfortable, well equipped for cooking and was extremely clean and well presented on arrival- he was even so kind as to leave fresh bagels, OJ and bananas. We had excellent communication with Justin and met him on arrival. A fantastic host and we can't recommend him enough."

When we arrived, the condo was exactly as depicted in the photos - extremely clean and well-organized, nicely furnished and quite comfortable.  As the other reviews mentioned, Justin had various amenities on the counter for our arrival - toiletries and laundry detergent (pack lighter and do laundry just down the hall), a parking pass and map, a Seattle guidebook, along with bagels, cream cheese, and not-from-concentrate OJ, which helped us enjoy the first morning without having to go out for breakfast. Enthusiastically recommend Jason as well as this condo."

I enjoy walking around cities and the apartment is located an easy walking distance to downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods.  The apartment is nicely furnished, very clean, and very comfortable.  Justin had a welcoming package with food, toiletries, and laundry soap.  He was waiting for us when we arrived from the airport which made check-in a breeze.  I would highly recommend this property."
37466201,4494948,7/7/2015,33025409,"Great apartment located near some iconic Seattle Landmarks - about a 20m walk from a lot of great places, like Pike Place, Pioneer square, etc. Justin left some snacks and instructions in the apartment as well which was very nice. "
37974824,4494948,7/12/2015,33084027,Justin was very accommodating and met us at the condo just as scheduled. He was extremely pleasant during our meeting and was more than kind and considerate when showing us the apartment. Detailed instructions were left which made it very easy to make ourselves at home for the time spent in Seattle.
39002586,4494948,7/20/2015,6618190,"All the good comments about Justin and the place are true. When I asked if he had a coffee grinder and he didn't have one, he bought one and a coffee press for my use.  He got bagels, OJ, and cream cheese, too!  
The location is just a 10 minute walk to the public market and downtown.   You can uber to Space Needle for minimal fare. Just right.
You can't go wrong with this place."
39915884,4494948,7/27/2015,22993542,"Justin was really welcoming and a fantastic host. The apartment was even better than described and we really appreciated the bagels and OJ. Perfectly clean apartment, comfortable bed and plenty of space for 2 people. Using the big screen to watch netflix was an awesome bonus too! Although it's a 15/20 minute hilly walk to the centre of Seattle, this didn't matter as the apartment was so nice."
41744421,4494948,8/9/2015,32798041,"Everything was so awesome - comforts of home, all the amenities, nice neighbors, close to many good food/coffee places. We would come back and stay here in a heartbeat. I would easily choose this place over a hotel room any day."
43743736,4494948,8/22/2015,13017777,"Justin's apartment is very nice. Well equipped kitchen. Newly decorated. Comfortable bed. Note about the bed: it is a foam mattress. We were concerned at first, but it turned out to be very supportive. We are older, 60+, but the mattress caused us no discomfort or next-day-soreness. The apartment is not as ""dark"" as it looks in the photos.  The big windows let in a lot of light. The views are basically of neighboring buildings, but you can see Mt Rainier (on a clear day, if you get one). The building is an older apartment building, but it has been well cared for. The neighbors were quiet and nice. Justin was very helpful and responsive.

On the location: we were surprised that ""First Hill"" was not called ""Cliff Side."" It is downhill to everything and parts of that hill are very steep.  It is one mile to the waterfront, most of which is a hill. We walked everywhere and the end of the day was always uphill. So be aware of that. If you rent a car, parking is available on the street, but not always easy to find. There are time limits and fees for street parking. The building is located beside several hospitals. There are emergency vehicle sirens all the time. And there are the normal city noises: traffic, voices, etc. Justin's windows block most of it, but if you like to have the windows open, it can be distracting.

The neighborhood is great: mostly residential in the immediate area, but within 1/2 - 1 mile to everything Seattle has to offer: coffee shops, great restaurants, shopping. Capital Hill has it all, even a pot shop. Capital Hill is very LGBT friendly, so if that bothers you, stay away. But there is no in-your-face gayness.

I give this apartment a very positive review. And affordable by Seattle standards."
45052173,4494948,8/31/2015,13598687,"Justin's place was awesome! It's in a wonderful location in Capitol Hill area full of great bars and restaurants. If you're looking for an LGBT friendly area, this is it! You're also a 15 min walk from downtown and it's super convenient to get to the Washington State Convention Center it's an easy walk away. 

Justin was very communicate and gave simple directions to enter his place without him being present. It couldn't have been easier. He was very courteous and a quick communicator. 

Justin's condo was in impeccable shape. Very clean, organized and nicely decorated. You can't miss the 100 inch projector which made for some epic nights of relaxation and Netflix vegging. In short, the place really felt like home and the complimentary water, fruit, and bagels was a nice touch. 

I will definitely be staying here again when I make it to Seattle again! Thanks Justin! "
48378739,4494948,9/26/2015,26366177,"The listing was accurate for what truly is an amazing place, the location is perfect within 5 min. walking distance of Washington State Convention Center as well as everything in downtown Seattle and host was fantastic by ensuring everything one could need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay was available (i.e. - towels, soap, shampoos,hairdryer, etc.). Would highly recommend for anyone coming to downtown Seattle."

The place was spotless. In addition to the snacks and drinks he had left, he provided an information sheet with all the pertinent information.

57923833,4494948,12/30/2015,50291659,"This was our first AirBnB experience. For us, any future stay will be hard pressed to top it! Our host and I communicated often prior to arrival. Every aspect of the visit was as expected or better - from arrival to departure - from the neighborhood to the condo.  Location is easy walking distance to nearby medical center, coffee shops, other neighborhoods and downtown which made it convenient for us to connect with family living nearby. Between walking, public transit and Uber, we had no need to rent a car for the two weeks. The condo is well kept and was a comfortable refuge each night after a long day out and about. All in all it was a very pleasant experience.

14214395,3242605,6/14/2014,4134112,"The Zen Den was the perfect spot for our little getaway. The private room in West Seattle was a peaceful retreat after a full day of touring the city and Jessica made sure to make us feel welcome while we were in her home. Public transit was nearby, as were shops and restaurants. Would love to stay again if we were visiting Seattle."
14318943,3242605,6/16/2014,5488246,"We stayed at Jessica's for only one night. The room was perfect. The kitties were cute and welcoming. We didn't actually meet Jessica, but even from afar she was really helpful. We will definitely recommend the place."

The room looks just like the photo. Didn't get to use the sauna, but it looks very nice, has digital settings. The area is super safe and quiet, more quiet because the room is clear at the back of the lot. Best night's sleep I have had in a long time."

15410505,3242605,7/8/2014,3836744,"Jessica's zen den is absolutely amazing. Comfiest bed and air mattress for extra guests, wonderful sauna, and beautiful environment. West Seattle is a really fun mix of city and beach town. There's also an easy bus to catch down town, but coming back to such a relaxing part of the city was a huge comfort. Jessica was also so sweet and responsive to all my questions. Overall really great place to stay! I would definitely want to come back."
15543736,3242605,7/11/2014,612554,The place was nice and convenient. Crashed there just for the night with my mom and sister on our day trip to Seattle from Portland. Never met Jessica but she provided everything we needed and the place was easy to find. Sauna was nice after a long day walking around town. 
15776743,3242605,7/15/2014,16951543,"Although we did not get to see much of Jessica because we were wandering all around Seattle most of the time, staying at the Zen Den was a great experience. I would definitely go back there again and would recommend the place to others."
15879028,3242605,7/17/2014,4350777,"Jessica's place was just as described - a green, peaceful oasis in the vibrant community of W. Seattle.  We loved being able to take just one bus to get us where we wanted to go downtown! Jessica was out when we were in, but we felt perfectly comfortable.  We'd definitely stay again."
16106354,3242605,7/22/2014,11630654,"Even if we haven't met Jessica, she left me all the information I need to reach her house. The room was nice and very well situated, close to Alki Beach and only 20 min bus ride from the Downtown. "
16259751,3242605,7/24/2014,2947094,"Great room and a great host. We only saw Jessica the day we got there as she's pretty busy, but we did get to hang out with her for cats which were all sweet and friendly. The neighborhood was great, and it was close to Seattle Centre, which was what we needed.
Room and house were clean and having the outside deck set was nice. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. Unfortunately we didn't make use off the sauna, so I can't comment."

16669505,3242605,7/31/2014,10935547,"Jessica's place is great! The space is very comfortable. There's an outside area to sit and have coffee or hang out. It's separate from the main house, so you have access to the kitchen and bathroom through a side door right next to the Zen Den. 

The location is awesome - just a quick walk to the water or to The Junction (this area of town). Great restaurants and funky boutiques. 

We had our dog with us this trip and found both her house and the neighborhood very dog friendly. Lots of places to walk your dog. It's a 15 minute drive to one of the best dog parks I've been to (Westcrest).

We were visiting friends and family closer into downtown Seattle and the drive was quick and easy every time.

The only downside was worrying about walking into her house to use the bathroom or grab some water in the middle of the night - which is pretty typical for me in general....

We didn't see her much, but whenever we ran into her, she was very welcoming. I totally recommend her space!"
16795648,3242605,8/2/2014,2044688,The Zen Den is a peaceful and secluded room in the back of the house - the trees helped keep the room cool in the summer heat. Really enjoyed our stay.

17352152,3242605,8/11/2014,14612228,"First let me say this is a great neighborhood! Really fun and everything is walking distance. Alki Beach and Schmitz park are a quick busride away. If you like staying away from tourist trap areas, then this is the place for you. Host was nice and welcoming, gave us fresh towels and everything. We were four, and although it was a bit tight, it was comfortable for crashing out for the night. "
17711000,3242605,8/16/2014,12037268,The host made feel at home and welcomed. She has an open personality.
17769218,3242605,8/17/2014,15725848,The room was nice and clean and the area was very quiet at night. Jessica welcomed us when we arrived but did not see him afterwards as she was working nights. Nice place and according to description!
18529618,3242605,8/28/2014,4961606,"The Zen Den was perfect for my stay.  A quiet residential street near friends.  Just a few blocks from West Seattles main street California Ave.  The bed and space is perfect for one person but 2 could easily manage. Easy access to kitchen and bath from deck near the rooms private entrance.  The cats were sweet, friendly and very respectful.  
Jessica was there to welcome me. Checked in mid week when our paths crossed. And was so sweet and thoughtful with gift of a vegan cupcake on my last evening.  Thank you Jessica."
18878027,3242605,9/2/2014,3586528,"We stayed at the Zen Den for four nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is ideal for anyone wanting a more quiet Seattle experience. Just a few minutes to Alki Beach and all the bars and shops of West Seattle. The room itself was immaculate and cozy. We never met Jessica during our stay but she was very communicative and thoughtful. Bathroom is shared and in the main house, this may not be ideal for everyone but it worked fine for us and was very clean. Overall I think this is a great airbnb and would love to stay again next time we are in Seattle."

The neighborhood was great, lots of excellent restaurants less than a mile away, and I had the chance to just unwind and rest as I needed to. The sauna was fantastic, and Jess couldn't have been more helpful. Will definitely go again if I find myself needing a place in West Seattle."
19126379,3242605,9/7/2014,17569762,"Jessica left us a cute little greeting card which includes the information for the WiFi network. She also provided the basic necessities such as towels and various items such as little soaps and shampoos. There is WiFi, so that's a plus. Just a note, there were two cats that I encountered during my stay. Overall, it was a neat Zen-themed room. "
19302932,3242605,9/9/2014,1312047,"Jessica welcomed me in person to give me the lay of the land. There was  a handwritten note on the table, and bottle of water for me as well as a little bowl and bottle of water for my dog. Really nice touch. Jessica was great at texting me with updates and checking in (e.g., I could come over early if wanted, where it might be slippery during a rain, etc.). I appreciated that. I didn't see her much after the first intro, but I felt like she was already ready and available.

I thought the room was great and would absolutely stay again. In fact, I think the Seattle PI paper just featured it as a cool place for a potential local staycation. The room is, as noted, a separate place with its own entrance at the back of the house. Very private and quiet. Inside, the warm-colored hardwood and sunset colors make it really warm. The bed was incredibly comfortable, which makes napping very tempting. And I did use the FAR sauna one night, which is a nice bonus. My dog was also with me, and it was simple and easy. As other reviewers note, the bathroom and kitchen are in the main house. It's a 10 ft walk down the deck to the door. I was a little worried coming in the house at night the first time, but Jessica assured me it was expected. I never saw anyone when I went in day or night, and it quickly became routine. If you do want water in the room at night/in general, you could grab a gallon at the local grocery store fora buck like I did.

As for location, West Seattle is great. The main street is a short walk away, with lots of great places for food, shopping. Huge fan of Husky Deli. Great dog park 15 min away, or head down to the walkway along the sound close by or 10 min up by Alki Beach. Great views and people watching. And if you walk around the neighborhood, you can see the Sound a few blocks away. If you want to head into downtown Seattle, you're a 15 min drive away.

I wholeheartedly recommend Jessica and the Zen Den.

The only drawback was having to go outside to get into the main house to use the bathroom, but that definitely isn't a deal-breaker. We never saw Jess during our stay, but she kept in constant contact to give us advice on where to go/answer any other questions. We would, and probably will, stay here again."

The neighborhood is so very sweet, with lovely historic homes, as is hers. Short walk to a cluster of restaurants and bars (around California and Alaska intersection).  Extremely pleasurable setting.

The room is GORGEOUS, warm and restful -- the bed and linens so soft and comfortable. The kitties hanging outside are approachable and friendly if you're interested in interacting. The bathroom/kitchen are only a few steps away, extremely easy access.  All orderly and easy to find what you need. 

I LOVED staying at Jessica's.  She has an obviously strongly individualistic creative/aesthetic sense which makes the space of the room, the area outside, and I imagine the other spaces as well, wonderfully filled with enlivening, interesting, thought-provoking, beautiful images. Recommended with absolutely no reservations!"
21642335,3242605,10/20/2014,2186884,The place was just as described. Although I didn't interact with the host she left a nice greeting card and everything went perfectly. I definitely recommend staying here!
22263898,3242605,11/2/2014,22731095,"I loved this place. The room lived up to its name- a cozy, peaceful, restful space. Beautiful aesthetic and with an infrared sauna in suite- nice touch. Jessica went above and beyond in providing some amenities, such as toiletries, bottled water, slippers and housecoats. There was free and easy access to the washroom and kitchen. I would have loved to meet Jessica, but didn't have the opportunity. Instead, I got to enjoy her charming cats :) (my choice). The place is located in a very cool neighbourhood, just a 15 min drive from downtown. There are great shops, restaurants and grocery stores around. Great value for money- I would stay again. "
23521278,3242605,12/3/2014,17242843,"Jessica is just lovely. Room was exactly as described. A lovely welcome card with all her contact information and bottled water were on the little table on arrival. The location is ideal. You can walk to the Junction, with great shops, restaurants and yoga and public transportation. The views of the water and mountains during the walk are spectacular .jessica responds promptly to all requests. If you want to be in Seattle in a beautiful neighborhood in an adorable house this is the place."
23715676,3242605,12/8/2014,6981697,This place does give out really good vibes. Jessica is truly a great host but we missed seeing her. We did see the cats and they became quiet friendly. It was cold and rainy outside but the den was warm. 
24023772,3242605,12/17/2014,9454359,Room was great! Jessica had everything ready and clean by the time we arrived so there were no issues. Great neighborhood! We walked home from the bus stop late at night on multiple occasions and felt safe. Would rent again!
24109775,3242605,12/20/2014,2879471,My host was very attentive to my needs but not in my face. The zen den was warm and comfortable. It felt like home when I arrived on my way back thru Seattle.
24296830,3242605,12/25/2014,6904515,"The zen den is a cozy room. When we came in it smelled great from freshly lit incense and there was a note card welcoming me since Jessica was not at home when I arrived. I actually did not see her the entire time of my stay but I did meet her roommate Dale briefly. It is a little bothersome to have to go outside from the zen den into the main house to use the bathroom, but it was as advertised. Overall I've of the nicest airbnb experiences I have had so far."
24537701,3242605,12/30/2014,23660822,"Loved staying at the Zen Den!! Really loved the neighbourhood, West Seattle Alki beach. Great restaurants and places to explore. Travelling with pets is always a challenge and I can say we all had fun. Comfortable bed, easy access to kitchen, friendly cats. I like the laid back feeling. Will come again. Thanks Jessica!"

Usually on vacations I have a hard time sleeping but I slept like a baby! It was a good location too, 15 minute ride from downtown and 20 from north Seattle! "
25506204,3242605,1/18/2015,25098738,"We had a great stay in the Zen Den!  We didn't get the chance to meet Jessica but she was very responsive to our needs and made us feel right at home.   The sauna is a definite plus on dark and rainy days.  There were a lot of special amenities to the room too like soaps and lotions, robes and sandals, candles and incense, books and games.  Would definitely recommend!  "

26561801,3242605,2/15/2015,7309494,"Staying at the West Seattle Zen Den was a nice getaway. Great for people who love cats/do not have cat allergies! The room is spacious with the sauna attached which was lovely to try out. The bathroom is inside the main house and just several steps outside of the door to the room. We did not get to meet Jessica during our stay, but she made us feel welcome with a box of Valentine's chocolates and a list of fun things to do in the area. We could not get our Wi-Fi to connect but overall we had a really positive experience! Would stay here again."
26891390,3242605,2/21/2015,27123828,"The place is cute, super quiet, in a beautiful neighborhood with an amazing view of the Puget Sound. Just perfect :)"

27478773,3242605,3/5/2015,28179578,"Jessica is awesome! She is kind, communicative and always attentive to your needs. I love her laid-back attitude. I felt  never felt so comfortable in some one else's house!

 The Zen Den is clean, comfortable and most of all relaxing.  I love the fact that the sauna has a MP3 adapter cord that allows for you to play music from almost any device. She also provided fresh towels and bottled water whenever I needed them!

Her place is a quick stroll from the best places (resturuants, coffee shops, bars etc) in West Seattle and not too far from the water.

I enjoyed every bit of my stay and can't wait to go back!"
27646117,3242605,3/9/2015,24008806,"We had a very nice experience at the Zen Den in West Seattle, which is a wonderful family oriented and quiet neighborhood.  Jessica was extremely accommodating and had laid out waters, robes and any necessities that one might require.  We only met her one time and it didn't feel like either party intruded on the other whatsoever.  The description is very accurate the room, kitchen and bathroom were kept spotless.  The bed was a memory foam and extremely comfortable.  Easy and plentiful parking.  The only slight downside is having to go outside, on the deck which is fairly private, a few steps to the glass doors leading to the kitchen and bathroom.  We would definitely stay there again.

You have to go outside to access the main house and bathroom, but it's only a 3 second walk. Had some issues connecting to the Wi-Fi, but overall our experience was great and I would recommend the Zen Den to my friends!"
28585618,3242605,3/26/2015,28247908,"The Zen Den was a perfect retreat for us. Close enough to the city to bike (not for beginners), drive or bus easily and the house and neighborhood were quiet and peaceful. Right down the street from a nice strip of stores and food. We had breakfast at easy street cafe which was great and about a 10 minute walk from the house. When we arrived the room was very clean and smelt nice! The bathroom and kitchen were accessible and also clean! There are cats in the house and outside which were all very friendly! I would definitely stay here again. I don't think the location and price can be beat. "
28640850,3242605,3/27/2015,30026617,"It was a pleasure staying at Jessica's Zen Den.

28969269,3242605,4/1/2015,30021078,"We loved our little stay at the Zen Den.  The room felt very welcoming and cozy and although we only met Jessica once, she was very accommodating!  The neighborhood was extremely quiet with beautiful houses surrounding the area and a somewhat short walk towards a few parks near the coast as well as walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  Keep in mind it is a private room but you have to walk a few steps to the main house for the restroom and kitchen!  I would recommend the zen den to my friends in a heartbeat."
29350568,3242605,4/6/2015,30176404,"We stayed in the Zen Den for 3 nights over a long weekend and this was our first airbnb experience! Communication with Jessica prior to arrival was pleasant. When we arrived the room was clean, inviting and all ready and looked identical to the photos in the listing. At first we were a little leery with the shared bathroom/kitchen but became comfortable quickly due to the inviting atmosphere. We loved the cats and there was usually one wanting in or out.  There’s lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and we had breakfast at the Easy Street Café. A quick bus ride downtown was also only steps away. The neighborhood felt very safe and is really beautiful with lots of older interesting character homes. Our dog also had a nice stay in the Zen Den.  I would definitely stay here again if we were in Seattle. Great first airbnb experience!"
29651684,3242605,4/10/2015,2686038,The house was easy to find and Jessica's directions were helpful as far as getting into the room and using the main house. Loved the cats. Loved the sauna. The the west Seattle area. 
30010022,3242605,4/15/2015,1196308,"The place was fantastic, probably one of the best places I have stayed at. Loved the room and the location. We found a fantastic Phó place after a recommendation from Jessica's brother. I liked the whole set up and would definitely stay there again!"

35108283,3242605,6/15/2015,33052980,"We had a great time staying at Jessica's place. Her home is very eccentric but welcoming. As a cat lover I loved seeing all of her cats in the main house. My only complaint is that the wifi signal was at times poor in our room, but this wasn't a huge issue. Jessica was very welcoming and prompt with answering all of our questions. I would definitely stay here again. Great place, great location.  "

36009002,3242605,6/24/2015,30841536,Jessica was friendly and mostly absent. There are other adults around but they keep to themselves.  We traveled with cats so it worked fine that her 4 cats have free roam. Easy access to the kitchen and bathroom. 
36282100,3242605,6/27/2015,32520900,"Jessica's place was welcoming and clean. The room is private and beautifully decorated. Though we didn't end up utilizing the sauna, the fact that it was there was a real treat. The house was easy to find (we traveled on foot) and in a great neighborhood that offers great views and cool eateries within easy walking distance. Jessica had a welcome note and key waiting for us upon arrival. The bed is super comfy and we felt welcome to use the bathroom and kitchen space in the house. The kitties were friendly and didn't enter the room without being invited, which we did because we liked them. Though we didn't get to meet Jessica due to a later than expected arrival and early departure, all of our questions were answered quickly via text and we never felt that we lacked anything. Excellent stay in a funky Seattle neighborhood. We will definitely stay here again when we have more time to explore the city!"

It is in a great neighborhood and easy to find. 
The room was nice and cool in the hot summer heat. I wish it was cool enough outside to want to use the sauna...next time! 
The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of space. 
I loved visiting with the cats who were always around to great me on the deck (I have 2 of my own).  
She had lots of little extras in room and (email hidden) case you traveled lighter than you planned! "

As soon as we walked in left me a cute card and the keys to her wonderful den with amazing little sauna inside. My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. She has an awesome backyard with friendly cats , they were so cute :), also very conveniently located to some local spots! My bf and I walked to this awesome spot for breakfast and vinyl shopping called easy street records. Anyways this was truly an amazing stay! I would stay here again. Thanks Jessica!,your fantastic."

37659160,3242605,7/9/2015,29658656,We loved our stay at Jessica's - the room is such a perfect space! The setup is perfect and sophisticated. It is a very short walk from the bus that will take you downtown (the C) and it's near little shops and cafes. We only met briefly but Jessica is a wonderful host and you're always greeted by at least one cat anytime you are coming or going. :)
38134738,3242605,7/13/2015,17844379,"We didn't actually meet Jessica, which I assume was just part of the undisturbed zen experience, but she was very nice over messages and she left a nice letter in the room with all the necessary info and tons of little shampoos/lotions/etc. It's a real little spa experience! The room is a little smaller than it appears in the photo, but it's still sizable and the bed is actually bigger than it appears, and a good bed is really all anyone needs! Her laundry machine was broken, which isn't a big deal in of itself, but considering we were coming to the close of a 3 week road trip and she knew of our situation, it would have been nice to know of this ahead of time since it was inevitable we'd want to use it. Of course that's minor, and overall we had a great stay! It's a great room with a great zen feeling and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to relax! "

The space was clean, quiet, and pleasant, just what we were looking for! It was a quick walk to Alaska Junction with plenty of eateries, shopping, bars, etc. We also walked down to Alki beach, a bit more of a hike but definitely doable if you're up for a long walk. 
Excellent host, beautiful space, great neighborhood, and affordable stay. We would most definitely stay again and recommend this space to anyone who wishes to visit West Seattle. Thanks Jessica! "

The room was peaceful, calm, and very clean, and Jessica is right her bed is super comfy! Jessica was very kind to let us enter in and out of her house for the kitchen and bathroom as much as we needed. I would certainly recommend her Zen Den to anyone wanting to check out Seattle. Also west Seattle is cool too. We didn't have too much time to check it out but on the Sunday before we left there was a farmer's market right in the downtown area. 

We definitely had a good time.

The area is quiet and her place is close to the stores, restaurants, dry cleaner or laundry facility.  It is close to Alki beach which is excellent location for walks and bike rentals.   It is also close to the downtown Seattle to check out all the touristy spots.   Met Jessica on my last day and is very nice.   "

There was a full kitchen available and a clean bathroom, though most of our time was spent sight seeing so we didn't need to use it. Her cats kept us company as well, very friendly.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle."

Jessica has clearly put a lot of thoughtful care into creating a sweet space. I'll definitely try to stay here on my next trip to Seattle. Hopefully sooner than later as I miss her cats already. :)"
49605551,3242605,10/5/2015,35918221,My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights. We did not get to actually meet jessica but she provided everything we needed. The room was great and cozy. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen were easily accessible and clean. The cats were very cute and playful! She lived just a few minutes from the junction were there are plenty of stores and places to eat. There was also a farmers market on Sundays that my girlfriend loved. I actually really liked the area that we were staying in. West seattle is very green and beautiful. It was a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend it!
50758328,3242605,10/14/2015,2705051,We enjoyed our stay at Jessica's den. It was comfortable and had everything we needed. We didn't get to meet Jessica but felt her hospitality throughout our stay. Her cats were so cute and friendly too! 
51025820,3242605,10/17/2015,25716162,"We unfortunately never got to meet Jessica, but nonetheless the whole process was easy peasy considering. She messaged me early in the day giving me detailed instructions on what to do and where to go. It was great. She told me I could message her whenever if there were any problems, but We never needed to. We had plans to go explore downtown soon after arrival but as soon as we opened the door we were kind of grounded! The whole place had a very soothing ambiance. There was incense, meditation books, A SAUNA..all in our delightful place. Namaste was everything we needed and that's exactly what we got. There is no bathroom attached so you do have to go into her part of the house, BUT she always made it available for you to do so at any time. The bus system is EXCELLENT. We didn't even need to rent a car. It's About a five minute walk to a bus stop, Starbucks, shops, restaurants and bars. We took the bus into downtown in the middle of rush hour, but it still only took us 20 minutes AND the best part is it runs ALL night. Totally worth not staying in the heart of downtown. In fact, it was MUCH better.  Her cats are super sweet and cuddly and it was nice to be greeted by their sweet meows and loves every time we came home. Jessica has a sweet set up here, I'd suggest it to anybody that enjoys some calmness to their vacations. "

51712145,3242605,10/24/2015,21662968,"Jessica's home is a wonderful stay. Her bed is AMAZING. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed in. The room is nice because it's separated from the house making it very private -- you don't feel like you are in Jessica's space at all. There's also plenty of street parking in her area. For first time Seattle visitors make sure you do your research because she is in WEST Seattle, meaning it will be a bit of a trek to get to the city at times. That being said there's plenty to do in the junction downtown (I recommend easy street records for brunch) and you can take the c line into town easily. She is super friendly and a Great host! "

52958439,3242605,11/3/2015,37171719,"Our visit to West Seattle was made so much better because we stayed in the Zen Den. My mother and I thought the room was great and the bed very comfy. The walls are burgundy not orange as they appear in the photos. Because we stayed for a full week, we got to meet Jessica and see her several times and she is so sweet. We had full access to the kitchen dining and bathroom. Coffee every morning and a computer on the table so I could check my email and watch a show on Hulu. I felt right at home."

Highly recommend staying here! Thank you for making our stay in West Seattle great! "
54698987,3242605,11/23/2015,11496787,"As a few of the other reviews mentioned, I didn't get to meet Jess, but wish I would have. Did meet her boyfriend and he was quite helpful upon arrival. Couldn't have asked for a better little spot and location during my visit to Seattle. The bathroom not being connected to the space (as mentioned in the description) is not as big of deal as it may seem. A little bit of an older house inside, but it fits the neighborhood and vibe perfectly. The house is a 5-8 minute walk to some neat coffee shops, restaurants and convenient stores. Easy Street Records is a must visit for breakfast. PHENOMENAL. I highly recommend Jessica's place (if you could not already tell). The sauna worked wonders each morning, the bed was super comfortable, and the house is perfectly located for all things Seattle. "

The space was fantastic as well. With a private entrance, spacious interior, fireplace to get cozy by...I couldn't have asked for more. The location was great too. Restaurants were very walkable, and I was able to take a morning run around beautiful Green Lake. 

The experience was everything I hoped for. I'll definitely be back!"

We flew into Seattle late, and she was very gracious about it. She was a very friendly, warm and helpful individual. The pull out couch was memory foam and seemed comfortable. The shower was a bit small, but not an issue for me. The basement unit is in a great location - a little ways away from the Space Needle, but had tons of things to do in the area (and not an issue if you have a car or one of those ride share apps). Ample amount of parking on the street. Felt like the area was very safe. "

It was a pleasant stay and I can recommend it as a quiet and friendly airbnb guest house. Sadly I didn't have a chance to meet Dario but his friend Ethan who stays at the house was there to take care of things. It's a big airbnb house with lots of interesting people coming through and walking distance from UW makes it a convenient place to stay for those visiting the campus.
42337521,7550234,8/12/2015,14638385,"Dario & Ethan were very kind, respectful & Knowledgeable of the area.  The apartment was great & the bedroom very nice. "

I was able to come and go easily on my own, but knew that if I needed anything I could immediately get ahold of my host. My room was great and had everything I needed laid out for me (wi fi code, towels, etc). Breakfast was available whenever you wanted it and included fresh fruit, huge plus. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

There was just one problem, the toilet on the top floor clogged often, if that is solved, everything would be just perfect. The bathroom was well kept otherwise; the kitchen was also very accessible and stocked with variety of food for the guests. Will love to visit again. Keep up with the great hospitality. "

Everything was exactly as described in the description on the Air BnB page. And I will add that the bed is quite comfortable, which is probably the most important part of any BnB experience. The room was quiet and the neighborhood was very walkable to be able to get food and other vitals. Very safe. The breakfast option was great with a variety of delicious options available, including good coffee, juice, and tea. Guests should be aware that breakfast is self serve, in case there is any confusion (I was not confused). Overall a very excellent and easy experience for a budget traveler. "
48920440,7550234,9/29/2015,4296281,"I had a great stay! It was clean, accessible and had a great selection of breakfast items. There was even Tylenol in the guest cupboard that made all the difference in the world. I would definitely stay again."

The neighborhood was quiet - although within walking distance of a Walgreens and a street / neighborhood that looked like it had some interesting things going on in the evening. Parking was easy to find, which I found extremely helpful."
54770065,7550234,11/23/2015,2424191,Dario and Ethan were awesome hosts! I was late getting into town and they were very flexible with my arrival time changing.

Just realize that this is a hostel-like setting with multiple lodgers in the same house.  Might not appeal to everyone.  Also, the breakfast food, while provided, is make-it-yourself; don't expect a big spread waiting for you in the morning."

The apartment was central and clean, the main lobby of the apartment complex had a very peculiar smell to it but that is no fault of the owners. The cats that are in the apartment are friendly and very cute, the bed was comfortable and the amenities were great. Thank you so much once again for taking me in on such short notice and treating me like family!"
50598278,2926776,10/12/2015,42173566,"It was entirely good. Location, price, etc. However, cats were irritating to me and friends so if you have some allergy about fur you should consider this house. If you dont have any allergy about that, just go!! "
51504154,2926776,10/20/2015,9772021,"Our stay at Leslie's place was fantastic! The place was bigger than I had expected which was wonderful! Her two cats are so sweet and a lovely addition to our stay and the location was fantastic too as Cap Hill was incredibly close! Uber fares from the house to downtown were not expensive either, ranging from $4-7! Leslie recommended some amazing restaurants/bars too, I would never have thought to go there without her help. She was quick to respond and checked in to make sure we arrived and were settled. I hope to actually meet her one day as she seems super rad! Thanks Leslie for everything, hope to be back again! "
53527423,2926776,11/9/2015,45902871,"My friends and I stayed here while attending a conference in November 2015 and had a wonderful time! The apartment is cozy, spacious, and has everything you need. We opted for watching their two cats who are adorable and super snuggly - if you like cats, definitely agree to watch them! The neighborhood is quiet (other than some ambulance noises because you're near a hospital) and there are several great restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance. We walked most places but using uber/Lyft is also very cheap. Overall, great place to stay and enjoy Seattle like a local!"
39234816,7327623,7/21/2015,38382309,"Jennifer is a great host, took me after a couple of minutes for a ride around the University District. The place is very calm and close to Seattle Downtown, which you can reach in 25 minutes through the Gilman-Burke trail by bike. I felt home and i could enjoy my privacy as some very good conversations as well. I was the first guest, and i could only recommend it to anyone."
40010110,7327623,7/27/2015,24247616,"Airbnb is such a genius idea. I've had yet another amazing experience. Jennifer is such a caring and thoughtful host in addition to being a talented creative/designer.  I got in later than expected my first night and she never made me feel as if I was imposing. She had numerous treats for me waiting and was always responsive/proactive for any questions/directions etc.  Her space is even larger and more cozy than I expected. Huge bathroom, skylight, peaceful, quiet. She's done a perfect renovation leaving no stone unturned in my opinion.  The tree-lined neighborhood is quiet, convenient to all of Seattle, close to bike trails, shopping, and also easy access to Bellevue/Kirkland.  Parking was easy and the whole experience was awesome.  I only wish I had had more time here. Although I did have time for a late night walk to Metropolitan Market for their famous chocolate chip cookie! ll be keeping in touch with Jennifer and would highly recommend staying here for the beautiful space and the good energy she brings to the experience. Thanks so much Jennifer!"

55128910,7327623,11/28/2015,18218325,"Jennifer made every effort to make the suite a home away from home. She stocked it with cookies and good ground coffee (it's Seattle after all). Her taste is obvious from the pictures posted but it's actually better. The bed was comfortable. The heating system permits zone differences, so we could go from a cool bedroom to a warm bathroom. Very nice. The neighborhood is very quiet with pretty good parking. It's close to the University, which is nice, even if you have no connection to it. We will be back."

It was very close to the Children’s Hospital, which was perfect for me because I was in Seattle for an interview. The bed was very comfortable and the place was super quiet, so I got great sleep. I used the AppleTV a lot, which was fun. It was very clean, and although the kitchen was small, it had everything I needed. There were lots of cute touches, like the basket of clementine’s in the reading room. I love it! The only thing I should let people know, and I know lots of people have already said this in their reviews and Jennifer reminds you when you get there, is that you have to be careful to not hit your head when you enter and leave. Same thing goes in the reading room. Just watch what you’re doing, and you’ll be fine! I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I had such a wonderful stay."

Great time. Great stay. Great people. "

Within 30 minutes I arrived at the place and met Karla and saw the room. I was really impressed with how spotless clean the place is! I don't think there was a speck of dirt or dust anywhere. I didn't spend a lot of time in the house other than to sleep, but it was a very comfortable and spacious room. Everything from the house to the bed to even the towels looked almost new! The house is also right next to the ferry for Vashon Island and Southworth, so great place to explore that side of the Seattle area. Very highly recommended. "

The park and ferry were literally across the street, which allowed for walking after dinner.  Sean was polite, congenial, and a fount of information.  We slept well.  And on Sean's advice we ate quite well too.  Had the best cup of coffee from their kitchen.  We will be back."
5520078,1205666,7/3/2013,7189238,Sean and his family were extremely welcoming and an ideal bnb experience. They are very courteous and earnest about providing a positive stay for their guests.

This family was kind enough to not only accept us into their home but happily accepted our feline family member too which was a huge relief for us. They took such great care of all of us! We even had a few chances to share a meal and some wonderful heartfelt conversations. Accommodating is an understatement, you will not be disappointed! The location is absolutely fantastic too! Practically right in front of the beautiful Lincoln Park and a stones throw away from the bus stop and ferries. 

It was hard to say good-bye but now we now know exactly where to send friends and family anytime they're in the area.

Their home is absolutely beautiful. It's just like the pictures, if not better. The neighborhood is very safe and right across from the park. It was so nice to be able to walk down to the beach and enjoy the view. This specific room that we stayed in was in the back of the house and very quiet. There was demolition/construction going on across the street, and I didn't even hear it until I went downstairs. Perfect stay. Thank you! We'll definitely come back if/when we're in Seattle."

If I had time to cook, I would have made breakfast for everyone because their kitchen is gorgeous! 

As for location, the house is close to downtown Seattle and reachable by bus or car. An additional bonus is that Alki Beach is just a short hop away, so if you are visiting Seattle during the summer time, this location is one of the best.

Once we drove off the ferry, it was only a few minutes to the house, perhaps half a mile, if that. Everything exceeded our expectations. Carla greeted us warmly, and all the amenities were attractive, spotless, and of high quality. We had a delightful chat with another couple that was also staying there, and we all enjoyed quite a substantial breakfast (yoghurt, eggs, coffee, tea, cereals, even a loaf of zucchini bread which Carla had baked for us -- delicious!). Thank you, Carla and Sean, for sharing your beautiful home with us. We hope to return! "

He was available to answer questions, but also gave us our space. He even let us use the washer/dryer which was an added benefit! The neighborhood was cozy, and being a 10min walk from the water was awesome. Be sure to check out sunset at the nearby Lincoln Park! By bus, the house was 30min from downtown and about 50min from the airport. I will definitely stay here again if I'm able to make another visit to Seattle!"

20148720,1205666,9/24/2014,19451700,"Before our arrival, Sean had sent a text message informing he is available should we need anything and that he was looking forward to meeting us. I was impressed with the proactive communication to start. 

As we drove through the neighborhood, we felt very safe. Once we arrived, we felt even safer. The home is beautiful and located in a very nice area.

Upon our arrival, we noticed the front door was open. I called Sean and within seconds he walked out to greet us. 

Upon entering the home, I was even further impressed with the cleanliness. We were given a tour of the home and a key for re-entry.

Our room was setup like a hotel room, only better. The bed was made very neatly, water bottles along with chocolates were on the table, and fresh folded towels laid at the foot of the bed. The bathroom was just as clean. 

Across the street is Lincoln Park--a beautiful park which opens up to the Puget Sound. A plus if you're wanting to enjoy yourself outdoors. 

The bed we slept on was EXTREMELY comfortable and clean. The sheets were very soft and it had us not wanting to get out of bed. Oh, and the sheets and towels smelled wonderful. We truly felt pampered. 

Location wise, I don't feel you could get any better. The home is 15 minutes from everything. So, if you're wanting a good ""HQ"" to venture out into the city, this is ideal. 

Each morning we had breakfast and coffee awaiting us. We had toast and yogurt. Nothing too extensive, but it's just perfect to get you started. You will also have full access to the kitchen and really every part of the home. We felt as if we lived there. 

The hosts were very social and their son is the smartest 4.5 year old we've ever met. They were both extremely knowledgable about Seattle, too. They had so many recommendations for us as we ventured out into the city. Much better than any concierge service at a hotel. 

I would HIGHLY recommend that if you're looking to stay in Seattle, book with them. 5 stars all around. 

Sean, Karla, and Seamus, thank you all for opening up your home and making us feel comfortable during our stay. You all are great people. Should we move to Seattle, we'll definitely keep in touch. Cheers. "
20206863,1205666,9/25/2014,6494821,"First of all, huge thanks to Sean and Karla for accommodating me at very short notice. A very comfortable room, clear information, no fuss. And their place couldn't have been in a better area - right next to beautiful Lincoln Park, where I (from England but more recently dry California) was reacquainted with the lovely smell of wet woods before carrying on with my journey."
20236853,1205666,9/26/2014,2157114,"We had a wonderful stay. Sean was so patient and kind when our already late flight was delayed.

From the soft sheets to the water bottles and chocolates to the breakfast provided and great recommendations from Sean, everything was perfect. Beautiful house located next to Lincoln Park and close to an amazing bakery on California Ave...great location in West Seattle. You will likely see us again if we are in the area! Thanks again Sean!!:)"

Sean and his wife are so gracious, kind, and incredibly easy to be around.  Their son, Seamus, is a delightful little boy.  By the time I left, I felt like family.  They had the bedroom beautifully decorated with all the amenities I needed; a cozy, warm bed, desk, comfy chair, and plenty of room for my clothing and belongings.  Chocolate, water and a snack were also awaiting me in the room. The bathroom was equally as lovely with space for my things, shampoo and conditioner and hair dryer.  The front sitting room with the beautifully decorated Christmas tree was very welcoming. They were extremely generous with sharing their space in the refrigerator, and the coffee in the morning was delicious.  "
24288314,1205666,12/24/2014,24975618,The house was verry clean and neat. You really feel safe in the whole area where the house is located. One of the good thing about the house is the 10 min walking to Alki beach.

29344606,1205666,4/6/2015,3218183,This is a gem of a place to stay. A gem. My wife and I were warmly welcomed and made to feel very much at home right from the front door. Everything about Sean and Karla's home is comforting and it's as clean and tidy and any home ever needs to be. Especially appreciated were the reading lamps provided on each side of the bed. Their neighborhood is simply wonderful for walking and exploring and feels very safe and it's remarkably quiet for being in the city. We will definitely want to stay with them again when in Seattle. The listing and other reviews are spot-on accurate.
30353127,1205666,4/20/2015,12937888,"Sean, Karla, and their son Seamus were wonderful to stay with. We felt very comfortable and welcome in their home and appreciated that they were so explicit about inviting us to spend time in shared spaces and eat their food. 

The room was even more comfortable than we expected. They are across the street from a large and really nice park. This was a wonderful and unexpected amenity for us, especially with our doggie in tow! "

32092332,1205666,5/13/2015,26512475,"After staying in Airbnb homes for a week, Sean's home was by far my favorite. His home is clean and beautiful, and right by Puget Sound and great running/walking trails. If you want to go downtown, there's a bus stop right by his house and only costs a couple dollars. Sean was flexible about our arrival and check-in time. Highly recommend!"
32219427,1205666,5/15/2015,24069180,"If there is a bathroom that can be called clean you will find it at Sean's place ;-) Great house, very kind family, very easy going! Breakfast and coffee was excellent. Recommendation for the local seafood restaurants was also a delicious choice. We also liked their ""stay safe"" card with information on the nearest hospital, etc. Just in case something happens.

Unfortunately, we could only stay for one night!"
33800473,1205666,6/1/2015,7862444,"Thanks, Sean and Karla, for such a memorable and superior stay at your lovely West Seattle B&B.  The convenience of being adjacent to a bus line that provided transportation both near and far was a real plus.  Also, its proximity to Lincoln Park and all the walking trails it has to offer was another treat.  And, of course, your fine room and bathroom accommodation fit my needs to a “T.”  And having the convenience of using your kitchen for breakfast could hardly have worked out better.  Interacting from time to time with your other guests was also a pleasure.  Perhaps I will be able to request another stay-over sometime in the future."
34078258,1205666,6/4/2015,3251726,"I had a four day stay with Sean, Karla and Seamus. It was wonderful right from the beginning. The home is classy but down to earth and impeccably clean. I felt right at home and yet knew that they were honoring my privacy. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
34541881,1205666,6/9/2015,23674057,"Sean is an extremely considerate host, and provided all the necessary information regarding parking, where to find keys, etc.  He responded in a very timely fashion to additional questions, via both text and phone.  The room looks just as advertised - and the bed is really comfortable!  It happened to be quite hot in Seattle while we were there, and the house itself was warm, but the window fan in our room cooled the temperature off nicely.  I would not hesitate to recommend the location (lovely neighborhood, just a block from Lincoln Park) and Sean as a host."
34970728,1205666,6/14/2015,1476589,"Sean and Karla's house was just as advertised. It was spotless and located across from Lincoln Park. I was made to feel welcome and very comfortable. 
If you dont want drive into downtown there is a bus stop a block away. Nearby were lovely places to watch a sunset. There are also a number of dining options on California Ave and along Alki Beach. 
I would definitely stay again. "
35845827,1205666,6/22/2015,30352418,My wife and 4 month old stayed at Seans in June in a bedroom with a shared bathroom. Very family friendly and clean.

They offered a range of breakfast accommodations and were gracious enough for us to utilize their full kitchen (silverware, plates, pans, etc) as well as fridge space.

As we were all very busy we did not have the chance to have a longer conversation. Anyways, they have a nice home, our room was big & clean & we even had our own bathroom as there were no other guests. The neighborhood is quiet & there is a nice park nearby where you can have a picnic or just walk around. We would definitely recommend this accommodation! All the best for your little family! "

Room is exactly like what is described, very clean and comfortable.  We didn't have much time so were not able to explore Lincoln Park right across from the listing.  We had several days vacation in Vancouver prior to arriving to Seattle and Sean was gracious to let us do a load of laundry there and also accommodated our late arrival due to our tight schedule and trying to see and experience as much as Seattle as possible.   Sean also recommend places in West Seattle to eat and catch a great view of downtown Seattle.  Highly recommend Sean's listing to anyone."

Es waren unsere ersten zwei Nächte mit einer Buchung via AIRBNB und wir sind so zufrieden gewesen, dass wir gerne wiederkommen möchten oder auch noch anderer Gastgeber und Städte dadurch kennenlernen möchten. Wir haben vor unserer Anreise mehrmals per eMail miteinander geschrieben und nach unserer Landung in Seattle  hatten wir direkt den Kontakt um zu erfahren, dass wir früher als geplant anreisen konnten. Uns wurde dann der Schlüssel übergeben, das Zimmer und Badzimmer gezeigt sowie alle Bereiche im Hause gezeigt, die wir mitbenutzen durften. "

Sean has always been there to greet us but after that he gives us a key and and we are welcome to come and go as we want.  I was recovering from knee surgery.  Sean encouraged us to put my ice ags into his freezer so they were good and  cold when I needed them to be. neighborhood is well established with many older homes. It is across from a big park on Puget Sound, easily accessible by foot. It is a wonderful place to stay and we encourage folks to do so."

All in all it exceeded our expectations and we would definitely stay again. 
5630588,136480,7/8/2013,1885291,"Shari & her husband Michael were so wonderful! They went out of their way to help us when we arrived and welcomed us like were were already friends. Their home is in a the Seawrd Park area that is just blocks from Lake Washington and within a mile of Columbia City shops, bars with live entertainment and delicious little restaurants (highly recommend Columbia City Bakery for coffee and baked goods!). The light rail station is a short walk away and is only a 20 minute ride to downtown Seattle and very easy to figure out. There are a lot of inclines to consider if you plan on walking or biking, but for the average person, I would say you can easily get by without a car rental if you're okay with a bit of walking. We felt safe even walking home at 2 AM. There is so much beautiful flora around, our walks to and from Shari & Michael's house took longer as we found ourselves admiring all of the neighborhood gardens!

The house and room was open, very well kept and bright just as described. They had a newly updated bathroom for us to use and they opened their kitchen for us to use as well. We had a chance to have breakfast, coffee and awesome conversation with them on our last morning as well. They have lived and raised a family in this home so they had a lot of insight on good places to walk to and sights to see that were a bit off the ""normal tourist path"". Michael is an avid bicyclist, so he can offer great suggestions for those who might want to bike around. Highly recommended to take a few moments to hang out in their backyard as well! They have a beautiful outdoor space to have breakfast, drink a late night glass of wine via candlelight and enjoy it all without the hassle of any biting bugs!

So honored to be their first Air BnB guests and can bet they will have many happy guests to come! If you are in this part of Seattle, Shari and Michael's place would be a peaceful and safe place for a single person or a couple to rest their head at night :)"
5871840,136480,7/20/2013,3406554,"Staying with Shari and Michael was probably the best way to start my AirBnB experience. Both were super friendly, funny, and amazing people. You'll feel right at home when you walk in the open door. 

The house is a short walk to Seward Park, a great place to relax and unwind. You can go swimming in Lake Washington or ride your bike/run around the path and trails. Really peaceful with nice views of the Seattle skyline off in the distance. 

If you're in the area you're probably wanting to explore a lot of Seattle. This place is a great location to make base camp for exploration. We had our car, so I can't comment on public transportation. But it only took on average 15 minutes to get to downtown from the house with our car. 

You won't regret staying here. Can't wait to see Shari and Michael again! "

Drinking a beer on their lovely patio is a really smoothing experience after a day in vibrant Seattle. The location is perfect to visit the city with your car or public transportation. It's also near a beautiful park where we went thanks to Shari and Michael who kindly lent us their bikes. They are very helpful and really easy to talk to, we enjoyed our time in their home.

6337327,136480,8/8/2013,3311734,"Shari's home and hospitality are unmatched. She greeted me at the curb, welcomed me warmly, and invited me to the her Seattle night out neighborhood block party. We chatted about my travels and her upcoming trip to Southeast Asia with husband Michael, shared travel tips, and discussed how great airbnbers tend to be. The bed was firm and comfortable, the view and sunshine (I forgot to close the blinds before bed, I highly recommend that if you don't want to be up with the sun) brilliant, and the bathroom-I could live in that shower. Awesome hot water and pressure plus lots of space and sparkling clean. Parking was easy.  I didn't go into the city while I stayed with Shari but the lake is a cpl blocks away and lovely. Come stay with Shari and Michael! They're wonderful!"
6437687,136480,8/12/2013,7746623,"Shari and Michael were excellent hosts. They were very friendly and welcoming. My friend and I were in Seattle for several days to attend a convention, and we greatly appreciated that they accommodated us returning home late. Although I was not around a lot, I enjoyed talking to Shari and Michael each chance I had. Michael shared his experiences and advice regarding travel around Washington, which made my trip home much more interesting than it would have been. The location was also great. The neighborhood was quiet and conveniently located near a bus line to the light rail or directly to downtown. They also have a beautiful home (and a very friendly cat). I highly recommend staying with Shari and Michael."
6784876,136480,8/25/2013,470807,"Staying in Seattle was a first class Airbnb experience! We felt home from the minute we walked in and Shari and Michael were lovely, funny and gracious hosts. Their place is gorgeous, the neighborhood is quiet and a swim in wonderful Lake Washington is just minutes away. Don´t let the suburban feel fool you though, downtown Seattle is minutes away (by car - and a few more minutes by bike)
Needless to say, the star of our visit was, of course, Miss Little, princess and ruler of the realms who will charm you with purrrrrr-fect behaviour. Thanks Shari and Michael and Her Catness, we had a wonderful time! *katia and joel*"
6897438,136480,8/29/2013,1661620,"The hubby and I went to Seattle for our first baby free vacation. We had an absolutely AMAZING time! First of all, Shari's house is absolutely beautiful. The backyard is lush and green and she has these cute little nooks in the front and back we you could sit and eat. The room is really cute and the bed is comfy. The house is right near Lake Washington which is just gorgeous. There is so much to do right in that area that we could've stayed in Seward Park the entire time. Shari and her husband were super sweet, easygoing, informative and helpful. They left these great Seattle magazines and guides in our room that were hella useful in planning out our days.  I highly recommend staying at Shari's!"

Her home is in a quiet neighborhood near the lake , so we were able to go for a peaceful walk and have breakfast at a nearby diner before we started our day. Would love to visit Seattle and Shari again soon!"

Shari and Mike were really welcoming and we enjoyed their company so much that we actually spent a lot of time with them. We went to the movies with them on our first night and on our second night they invited us to join them in a family dinner with their son, son's wife and family friend. We hit it off with their family too and their son and son's wife gave us lots of tips about what to see and do in South America.
We'd love to stay in touch with Shari and Mike because we really felt like we made new friends by the time we left their home.
REALLY recommend staying with them!"

The house was great overall and quite spacious, and the room was very private and just across from the bathroom. Her dog is also so adorable and extremely well behaved! My only concerns are that if you're wanting to enjoy the patio furniture- ask her about where the cushions are beforehand, because we didn't cross paths much and the chairs had no cushions and weren't practical to spend time on (which I was stoked for). I also had problems connecting to the internet and there was no shampoo/conditioner provided, but if you ask her about these things asap I'm sure she'll take care of them."

I had short stay over before leaving early to an early morning group bicycle ride from Magnuson Park to Seward Park and looping back to Magnuson Park -- 25 miles. I didn't have chance to utilize the coffee or chance to buy grocery from nearby QFC. I did have chance to eat at nearby Bick's Broadway Grill restaurant that opens at 5pm and really had a nice meal and had a hot shower that let me fall asleep.

Tom is a natural host, and made me feel very comfortable. He used to work for the Seattle City Council and knows Seatlle inside and out.  He helped me navigate the bus system, pointed out some key neighborhoods and gave me great dining ideas.

Some visitors may need more of a kitchen/dining area. The amenities were sparse, but it was perfect for me because I didn’t want to cook. I had all I needed   to make coffee in the morning and heat up leftovers in the microwave. The small fridge worked well for me but, if you’re planning an extended stay in Seattle, you may want a fuller kitchen.  

The bed was really comfortable. The bedroom is well furnished, and it had good closet space. Tom has great taste and the space is well decorated with a great flow. I really enjoyed my stay and my host. I highly recommend it.

Tom's apartment location is totally awesome!. You can go to nice pubs and restaurants, hang out by the green lake and you can find all of it in a walking distance. You can also find a big supermarket close to the place so you totally don't need a car to get the groceries. There is also a very good bus connection to downtown!

The area of the house I stayed in (the top floor) was spacious, comfy, and nice (there's a shower with a steam function and a very large bath tub). The space is also sectioned off from the rest of the house so there's a good amount of privacy. 
There's also a nice mini fridge which was super useful as I sometimes did not finish my snacks or dinner (so I was able to save it for the next day). The area is easily accessible by bus, but I ended up getting around using Uber. 
It was as sweet as the title name says and we would definitely recommend Tom's home."
14927317,2420536,6/29/2014,16591213,"Tom couldn't have been a more gracious host! He took great care of prepping for our arrival and making sure we knew where to go and places to see in order for us to thoroughly enjoy our stay. His top floor, was modern and luxurious like shown exactly in the photos. Parking was easy and the vibes from Tom made us feel comfortable and welcome to come back. The extra large bath tub and the steam shower is something usually unavailable at most other places so be sure to stay here! We had an unbelievable stay and highly recommend Tom as your host of choice! Thank you again for everything and see you soon Tom. "
15322625,2420536,7/7/2014,429467,"Tom's Sweet Suite is top shelf.
The room is clean, simple, classy decor with quiet upgrades all around.
The bed is firm with a memory foam top, making a lovely nest.
The tub is enormous, the rain shower a pleasure.
Tom had attended to every detail before arrival - EO soaps for the tub, Tully's Coffee, snacks and teas, creamers and sweeteners, notepads and pens - even a bar set was waiting just in case.
Tom was very friendly, available for recommendations and conversation if we wished, yet easy-going and gave us space.
The house was very quiet and the neighborhood peaceful, attractive and near many small university restaurants.
We really enjoyed breakfast at Morsel a few blocks away.
Thanks Tom for a great place to rest in Seattle!"

We got the code to open the house door and it was super easy and fast to get in. Tom was there, and even though it was midnight, he still showed us our Suite. It was extremely spacious, and even had a huge walk in closet. There was a little kitchenette area with a Microwave, mini Fridge, Coffee Maker and Tea Kettle. The area was full of coffee (Life Saver!) Microwavable Mac and Cheese, microwavable oatmeal, plates, silver ware, mugs and glasses with a Brita Water Pitcher. The bathroom was fantastic, all new and remodeled and even had a steam shower. Upon opening the bathroom drawer we found dental floss, conditioner, shampoo, and a blow dryer. Everything you may need. Tom was a fantastic host, the apartment was super clean, well stocked, spacious. We'll stay here again the next time we visit, the Sweet Suite was perfect for our weekend getaway!"

The suite was very spacious and the shower was the best one we had during our trip including our stay at The Residence Inn in Portland. Tom went out of his way to provide the little extras that made us feel at home including snacks and breakfast items as well as sunscreen, dental floss, shampoo and even candles for the hot tub. He even helped us carry our luggage out to the car upon departure. Thanks Tom for your hospitality."

Very nice, quiet nights sleep. Only a 10-15 minute drive to downtown. We didn't have a lot of interaction with Tom because we were out most of the time, but he was very helpful and friendly. He obviously takes a lot of pride in his home. We would definitely stay here again. "

Best of all is the bathroom, which is very nicely appointed, with a spa-quality shower/steam ""room."" Very nice!

The large soaking tub and steam shower were a great treat after a long day of hiking around the area and exploring the the U of Washington Campus.

28032166,2420536,3/16/2015,9144576,"Tom's place is great, we're really jealous of the fantastic bathroom. My mother and sister stayed for two nights and both really liked it.  Just be aware that Tom's place has a lot of steep stairs to the unit.  That was fine for us, but won't work for folks with mobility issues."
28533556,2420536,3/25/2015,28894299,Comfortable place to live. Offered a lot of food.

The bathroom was amazing, nice big tub and the steam shower was great after a day of exploring the city. There were even little snacks (top ramen, Mac n cheese, popcorn, etc) in case we wanted to use. Tom was a great host, accommodating, knowledgable about his city and overall super friendly. We'll definitely be staying here next time we're in Seattle!"
29896034,2420536,4/13/2015,702535,"This should be called the Super-Sweet Suite!  It was an awesome experience. The listing and space are exactly as described, except even better. The property is on the top floor, so there are stairs, but it has its own locked entrance and was quiet, professionally cleaned, much larger than I thought and fully stocked with all kinds of amenities, male and female, bath, spa and personal care items, food, snacks, coffee, teas and more. There was filtered water upon arrival. The windows opened, yet the wooden blinds blocked light. The apartment is full of upscale touches even the Trump Hotel doesn't have, such as a motion sensor nightlight (handy if you get up in the middle of the night), light dimmers, aroma oils for the incredible 4 person large steam shower, nice rugs, and a separate room that is a kids hideaway dream loft. There are tea candles around the tub. It was just a fantastic place. Parking is easy. The experience was Excellent!  Tom is a gracious communicative professional and obviously enjoys being a great host. I would totally stay here again. In fact, it is a nice enough space for a honeymoon or would make a fine place for a couple and 2 small children as well. "

Everyone loves the bathroom, so do us. The location is good and convenient to get to the sightseeing spot. We use Uber most of the time.Tom and his neighbors are all very nice. We absolutely recommend Tom's sweet suite. We love it!"
30804057,2420536,4/27/2015,30420782,"The suite was very tastefully decorated, roomy and recently remodeled  with wonderful attention to detail. For example: full mini-tea/ coffee area with well supplied products, microwave, mini-frige a. the bathroom was beautiful  with large hi tech tiled shower, large soaking tub, towel warmer, two shower heads, seating area and wall jets that are startling if you have never experienced them. and also well stocked with every product that a woman or man needs. Large walk in closet/dressing area  had great shelving, many towels, separate cloth hanging areas ,first aid kit  etc. Two Tvs, with cubby hole room with air mattress for kids. If stairs are a problem, be aware that the front door is two stories up and then the suite is another steep and narrow flight up but we are in our 70's and were able to manage . Location is easy to find and parking on 15th Ave NE is easy except 4-6 PM on weekdays but usually easy to find about ½ block away. Suite is on 2nd floor with owner in basement and two other renters on 2nd main floor but were quiet and rarely seen. Across the street from Roosevelt High School which would only be an issue about 7-8 A.M. with traffic. Near the U Dub and the hi end  U Village shopping center which is full of restaurants and shops. Convenient location to groceries and other restaurants  in neighborhood.Comfortable bed, quiet and if needed, very functional kitchen.well stocked with utensils and access to dining room and living room."
31728584,2420536,5/9/2015,18170201,"Tom sets the standard for an outstanding Airbnb experience! I stayed at his house for 2 nights with my daughter while she looked for an apartment to rent near the university. The upstairs bedroom and bath are comparable to a 5 star hotel suite---quiet, private, and very nicely furnished with a lot of attention to detail. The main bedroom has a queen bed, and there is a twin bed in a small room off the hallway. Both were very comfortable. Tom had to work late on the day we arrived, but he provided detailed instructions in advance, and we had no trouble reaching him when we had a question.  Tom was a friendly and gracious host, and I enjoyed chatting with him a couple times during our stay---he provided helpful information for my daughter who is moving from Michigan to Seattle. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Tom’s house, and I’m sure I will be back again. "
33010046,2420536,5/24/2015,32459845,"Tom is the man, he welcomed us with a friendly style, and his listing is accurate, first I thought he might download the image from the other hotels, but his house is like a hotel, especially his outstanding bathroom, his bathroom has a steam bath shower, which makes us relax. Tom also provide a ton of food for us, and we no need to go to restaurant to have an breakfast. Overall, I will suggest people to stay in Tom house, if you want to travel or have a business trip in Seattle."

34167838,2420536,6/5/2015,33311605,"Myself and my two friends really enjoyed staying in Tom's Sweet Suite. It was the perfect amount of space for the three of us. Tom was always available via cell phone with any questions or concerns we had, and was around the house (he lives on the bottom floor) in the evening. The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous and accommodated 3 girls perfectly (so many towels!). He even provided some snacks. The bed was comfortable, and the whole suite was very clean. The 2nd room with the two stacked mattresses was smaller than I thought, but it wasn't a problem for us. The neighborhood itself was very pleasant. We would sit in the backyard and I very much enjoyed listening to the marching band from the high school across the street practice. There were breakfast places, convenience stores, and pubs nearby as well, all in walking distance. Parking was easy and free - right across the street. The other individuals who live on the main floor were also so kind and helpful and didn't seem bothered by our questions or small talk. When I return to Seattle, I'll definitely be trying to stay at Tom's suite again!"
34490620,2420536,6/8/2015,15938400,"Tom's suite was much more than we expected.  It was large, inviting and beautifully decorated. The setting is very private on the third floor. The suite was stocked with anything you might need, even some delicious candy. Tom was hardly around, but when we saw him he was very nice to talk to and very willing to give suggestions and advice on Seattle.  The inside of the house as a whole was very quiet. It is across the street from a high school, but we had no issues with that at all. Parking is conveniently located across the street. All in all, we were very comfortable in our Sweet Suite and will stay there again."

This suite is beautiful and comfortable. I had to adjust the dates of staying for a few times, since the change of travel plan. Tom was kind and flexible to accommodate that. Overall, the staying was wonderful, and I give Tom and his property a 5 star rating. Thanks, Tom.

35417949,2420536,6/18/2015,25919357,"Tom and his house are awesome. The best bnb I have ever met. I will give him a five-star!! Beautiful house and lots of snacks and coffee.

If I need a place to stay in Seattle, tom's place is definitely the first choice."
35944020,2420536,6/23/2015,33681559,"Tom was a very gracious host and we didn't encounter anything unexpected. Our week was activity-packed with many scheduled events to attend and had family members scattered around Ravenna, so we weren't around much to spend quiet times at the suite. On the check-in day, we went straight to a museum after picking up my sister from the airport and then headed to a dinner gathering from the museum. So we checked-in late, I'd say ~ 11 pm.  Though we had the entry code, Tom stayed up to greet us at the door and to show us around. The place is cute, as you see in the photos; a packed linen closet and bathroom full of accessories.    BTW, there's a local fruit/vegetable stand at the corner intersection and a Whole Foods Market a few blocks down which came in very handy for quick breakfast needs.  His place is ornate; reminded me of New England homes with character! I'd recommend this suite to anyone, especially with a 'little munchkin' (who can sleep inside the small Nintendo room).  "
36132865,2420536,6/25/2015,35356971,Tom is such a great host! He was very friendly and had lots of great tipps and recommendations for our time in Seattle! We had a whole floor of his house to ourselves with everything you could wish for! It was better than almost all the hotels we stayed in during our trip. Parking was easy as well. We would stay with Tom again without even thinking!
36606926,2420536,6/29/2015,36169533,"Photos and description of this property were completely accurate and did not disappoint.  We spent four nights there for three adults.  The small extra bed is tucked away in a small area to the side of the stairs, private and under the roof, not for the claustrophobic, but very comfortable and with it's own TV.  Master bed is a comfortable queen in a pretty room with nice bedding, furnishings, coved ceilings, great dimming lights, nice wood finishes and louvers over the window.  The entire suite is well equipped and just as nice or better than the photos.  Plenty of privacy upstairs with it's own access and locked door.  Tom has other tenants who live on site who are polite and accommodating and willing to answer questions.  Tom went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and even left chocolate, coffee, chilled water, china, glassware and flatware.  The small refrigerator and microwave worked well and the coffee maker was well stocked and nice to have in the room.  Our stay was warm, up to 90 degrees during the day which is very unusual for Seattle.  Tom provided fans and a spot air conditioner to help make us comfortable.  I was concerned about parking being offsite, but it was absolutely convenient and just a very short walk across the street, next to the High School with shade trees and is on a very quiet side street.  No problem at all - it was the only part of the city where we didn't have to search or fight for parking.  We didn't really use the common area on the main floor, but it was available and convenient if we had needed it.  The tenants were quiet and polite and didn't disturb us at all.  The back yard is shady in the afternoon and close by if you need it.  Freeway access to Capital Hill, Downtown, Space Needle and the University of Washington is convenient and easy to negotiate on Interstate 5.  SeaTac is farther, but still convenient and I would prefer this location to the airport since it puts you closer to most of the nice attractions in Seattle and some great neighborhoods and restaurants.  The neighborhood is quiet and was safe and easy to access.  I would absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend Tom as a host who goes the extra mile to ensure the guests are comfortable.  We had extra towels we didn't use, plenty of dishes, paper supplies, reading material and area guides.  There's a Safeway grocery store very nearby for any food you need and several restaurants.  We took a side trip to Gig Harbor and Bremerton and came back into Seattle on the Ferry about 5:30 pm which gave us fantastic views of Seattle and the Sound.  Highly recommend it if you have an afternoon and don't mind the drive up I-5 through Tacoma.  Thanks Tom.  We loved staying in your home.  Love the attention to details and your taste in décor."
37073253,2420536,7/4/2015,35086897,"On day 1, due to our flight schedule, we did not reach until 1:30AM. Tom greeted us and helped us get settled. If our travels take us to Seattle, we certainly will stay at his place. Tom is a gracious host and has made his unit everything a guest would need and want. "
37387219,2420536,7/6/2015,35740169,"Tom's suite is a lovely place to stay. The furnishings and artwork are beautiful. He made sure we had snacks, chocolates, water, dishes, whatever we might need. The beds were comfortable. The neighborhood was really nice. His home is convenient to bus lines which took us everywhere we wanted to go. 

My only complaints are that the air conditioning wasn't working and there was no soap or shampoo in the shower. The AC would not have been an issue but we were in Seattle during the heat wave of the century. 

All in all, I highly recommend the Sweet Suite. I hope to stay there again if I come back to Seattle. And Tom was a very generous, kind host."
37989964,2420536,7/12/2015,2601440,"We had a great stay with Tom. This is by far the best thought-out accommodation we have booked through this site. Everything you could want is provided for an easy stay. Some highlights include the huge bath (very relaxing), and the large amount of storage space for bags and hanging space for clothes. Parking was very easy in the street adjacent to the house. Tom was a brilliant host and very knowledgable about the local area and travel generally, always up for a chat if required. Highly recommend Tom's place if you're visiting Seattle!"
38618121,2420536,7/17/2015,35577293,"My grandma and I stayed in Toms suite for 3 nights and Had a wonderful experience. It matched the description given by Tom and had a few extra goodies that made our stay excellent. We ate at one of the Italian places in his guidebook on our first night in town. It was one of the best Italian food places I have been to, and it was within walking distance of the house. Overall the suite is well decorated and furnished and I would highly recommend it if you are staying in Seattle. "
38906800,2420536,7/19/2015,13426077,"Tom was very kind and personable. He clearly makes every effort to offer a comfortable place to stay. Good sheets and towels, nicely decorated, lots of bathroom supplies, emergency supplies, dishes. The neighborhood is not ideal....lots of boarded up homes in the next block and nearby and the traffic on 15th can be loud. Three things might have helped: 1. if the back patio was cleaned up and more inviting (as in the photo) 2. if the air conditioner worked. Tom said he was going to resolve this when we left because he recognized it can be an issue. We were very uncomfortable because the whole floor was sweltering despite fans. We did not ask for one but it would have been nice to be offered a bit of a refund from the higher weekend rates and fees we paid. 3. if there were different sorts of snacks available. We didn't eat or use any of the offerings. Top Ramen and the like. Would have been nice to have a healthier choice. Again, Tom seems like a really good guy and it may be a great place for someone else. For us, we would not go back."

It was very hot during our stay in Seattle, but Tom had thoughtfully installed an airconditioner before we arrived!  

I had thought that parking might be a challenge, reading the listing, but the parking location behind the school is actually just across the street and we never had a problem.

Thank you for accommodating us during a fun weekend in Seattle!"
41228621,2420536,8/5/2015,2065070,Nice and large room with all the facilties you may need and more. The only think we strongly suggest to improve is the air conditioning. Unfortunately we never met the owner but we were in touch with him via email. The neighbourhood is not much populated with many houses permanently closed in the area although it seemed quite safe and there's one grocery near the house. If you wish to go downtown expect 30min by bus. 
41453653,2420536,8/7/2015,39068722,"Everything in the description is very accurate! we met Tom on our last night, and he was very generous and made sure we were set up ok. I would definitely come and stay at this Sweet Suite again. "
42185168,2420536,8/11/2015,34475087,Room was nice inside. House needs much repair and is near many boarded up houses and chain link fences. Didn't interact much with Tom but he was certainly friendly.
42743006,2420536,8/15/2015,26247858,Tom's room was as described and is big.  There's surplus supplies of bedsheets and towels.  Tom is very helpful and nice.  We got warm welcome from Tom and he is willing to provide things we needed.
43249869,2420536,8/18/2015,28585621,"Tom's place was a great fit for our family. We were just returning to the states after living abroad and needed something close to family, in walking distance of shops/restaurants, and big enough for our family of four. The extra ""bedroom"" was perfect for our four year old who enjoyed having his own space. The large bath & shower were lovely after our long travels. Bed was very comfortable, and there were plenty of linens and extras on hand. Tom was very welcoming and stocked the room for every need. We would definitely recommend staying here. 

Our only ""concern"" was keeping our 1.5 year old from the staircase. The stairs leading to the second floor are very steep (as is the norm for all homes in the area), and the opening to the stairwell is next to the bed. I would not expect the host to do anything about this! Just a thing to note for families that may have a little one along.

The suite was just as pictured & described, with a lovely room and very beautiful bathroom, which was the best feature, in my opinion.  The neighborhood is in a good part of northern Seattle but it is located on a busy thoroughfare so be prepared for some street noise.  All in all, a very good place to stay and well priced."

We didn't have a lot of time to spend over there as there were things we wanted to experience.  But overall, it was an awesome time.

And it was a great experience for my first time using Airbnb."
50508498,2420536,10/12/2015,9205502,"Tom's Sweet Suite is not to be missed! This is a lovely home and the suite is much more than we expected. We only got around to using the steam-room shower at the end (the shower was great, but we hadn't used the steam feature). It was like living in a spa hotel, but more like being at home at the same time. Everything was perfect and Tom and housemates made us feel welcome.

The area is nice for getting out for a walk. Green Lake and many shops are walking distance and even the university is only about 30 minutes by foot (and has a good bus connection).

We'd gladly come again and certainly look forward to it sometime in the future."
51154756,2420536,10/18/2015,44041326,"Tom had many special touches that made my stay wonderful.  The room/suite was full of amenities, from great snacks to extensive information about the area and neighborhood.  The house was quiet and incredibly clean.  Would definitely stay there again."
52369209,2420536,10/28/2015,32844335,"Tom's suite was extremely nice. Tom stayed in contact with us throughout the day as our plans changed due to a missed flight and greeted us when we arrived at the house around 7:30. He was very hospitable and helped us get our luggage in after showing us around the space. 

The suite was very comfortable and clean. Tom has thought of pretty much all of the little details to make sure that people have everything they need. Light switches are labeled, information about the house is readily available on a sheet that Tom has printed out, there are brochures for things to do in Madison, coffee and snacks are provided, and the bathroom is full of any toiletry you can imagine. The steam shower and soaking tub are fantastic and help to create the impression that you are staying in your own personal spa.

The location was exactly as the listing described and the neighborhood was very convenient to the UW area, which was the purpose of my trip. It was also just a short trip to get to Downtown to check out the Pike Place Market and we were able to easily visit with friends in the Capitol Hill, Fremont, and Green Lake neighborhoods.

Although we didn't get to spend a lot of time with Tom due to our busy schedule, our brief interactions were very pleasant and he was helpful in offering suggestions for attractions and food nearby. "
53168009,2420536,11/6/2015,18683398,"Even before I arrived, Tom helped me feel welcome by responding quickly to all my emailed questions and requests.  Knowing that I was arriving before the official check-in time, he encouraged me to head to the house straight from the airport and relax in the common area until the Suite was ready - when I arrived, the Suite was ready for me early (clean and well-stocked with toiletries, maps/tourist information, snacks, and extra linens/blankets), which was a wonderful welcome after a long trip from the East coast.

The Suite (especially the amazing bathroom) surpassed my expectations based on the listing, and the neighborhood was convenient for public transportation, walking to restaurants, shopping for groceries, and access to local parks.  Walking alone at night, I felt quite safe there.  Having access to the basement washer & dryer, was also a huge plus.  

Tom was extremely hospitable whenever our paths crossed during the 4 days/nights I was there, and encouraged me to make myself at home in his house, which was easy to do.  I was staying in Seattle in advance of my goddaughter's wedding outside the city, which was the following weekend at Cama Beach State Park.  With regard to our various wedding preparations, Tom was extremely generous and flexible:  my goddaughter's younger sister ended up staying with me in the Suite and Tom graciously welcomed her; and he allowed us to pack his basement refrigerator with lots of groceries we bought for the wedding weekend.  Over and above his role as Airbnb host, he was a huge help in our wedding preparations.

I would happily stay there again if I were in need of lodging in Seattle.  "
53434099,2420536,11/8/2015,20730202,Tom's hospitality was amazing.  The suite was larger than expected and is very nicely updated with a great feeling.   Includes many thoughtful extras and details that were appreciated.  Would for sure stay here again given the chance. Highly recommended for a cozy indoor stay.
55727541,2420536,12/5/2015,12403346,"We had a wonderful stay in Tom's upstairs studio. We felt very welcome, the neighborhood was safe, and the giant spa bathtub was amazing. There were snacks waiting for us, and it was a relaxing place to come home to during a whirlwind Seattle trip. Thanks, Tom!"
57049225,2420536,12/21/2015,30836306,"Tom's place is an amazing gem that I will definitely consider should I come by Seattle again. The suite was huge with plenty of space for my family of 4. There were lots of nice little touches that made the stay very welcoming. It really felt like a home away from home. Tom himself was prompt in all communication and answered all my queries. It was a wonderful experience for us!

57455703,2420536,12/26/2015,49657107,"Tom has thought of everything to make your stay fun and worry free.  The space is classy, clean, and spacious.  You won't believe the luxury in the bathroom.  The shower is also a steam room and the materials throughout are top notch.  "
35712876,6002165,6/21/2015,35132192,"The Huey House was fantastic from booking to our departure.  It's in the coolest neighborhood and the location was perfect for a family weekend.  This is very much a family home, not a professional rental.  The Huey Family was super accomodating and straightforward.  When we arrived there was a basket with beer and juices for the kids and they were cool enough to have toys for the kids laid out and soap/shampoo in the bathrooms. There was plenty of everything and we felt welcome in their home.    We are grateful."
45091828,6002165,8/31/2015,37357754,"Amy was fantastic and so accommodating. Our flight arrived earlier than check in  and we were able to check before the posted time. The the house was so warm and comfortable.They left us a nice welcome basket in their beautiful kitchen.  We loved the outside patio and BBQ was great for our family.  On our 3rd and 4th day,the weather turned pretty stormy and they emailed us  from out of the country to make sure we were ok and  wanted to know if we needed anything.  The house is within walking distance to markets, restaurants and the junction. We had a great time and will be back again-this is a great house for your family.

210877,72743,3/28/2011,404637,"I came to Seattle on a job transfer and needed a decent place to stay for a few weeks at an affordable price while preparing to move our household to the area. I could not have been more fortunate with the choice of Jennifer's home.

Jennifer is a wonderful, hospitable host! She helped me feel at home from the very beginning.  Her house is in a quiet neighborhood in the Highland Park neighborhood of west Seattle, near Westcrest Park, a nice place to take a walk or go for a run. 

The house is well located vis-a-vis public transportation. Nearby bus stops are served by the #23 bus, making it easy to get to and from downtown Seattle in less than 30 minutes. SEA-TAC Airport is a short drive away via Highway 509. 

The guest room is pleasant, nicely furnished and decorated, and has a variety of conveniences, including a small refrigerator, microwave, and cable TV. The double bed is VERY comfortable. Between the dresser, nightstand, and closet there is plenty of storage room for the casual traveler or for the longer-term guest like myself. The guest rooom also has a chair and small desk just right for a computer, plus there is fast and secure wifi access to the Internet.

The bathroom is a few steps away from the guest room. It is clean and bright, with a tub and shower combo. Guests also have access to a washer and dryer, a most useful convenience.

Jennifer makes her kitchen available to guests who wish to prepare  meals. She is also a capable cook and baker, and is generous in sharing her delicious creations with her guests. 

If I could give a rating higher than five stars, I would do so. As you search out opportunities for a pleasant and convenient home stay in the Seattle area, put Jennifer's home at the top of your list!

"
266481,72743,5/16/2011,336410,"Jennifer is a wonderful host and her lovely home is a great place to stay. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again or recommend it to my friends and family. She is both open to friendly conversation and respectful and very considerate of your own privacy.  West Seattle is a great place to stay. Driving north on Highway 99 can get you downtown in less than 30 minutes. You don't even need to go downtown -- West Seattle has some great places of its own to eat and explore. Jennifer's home is located on a nice quiet street. She is a meticulous and hardworking gardener so the exterior of her home is well tended and filled with a nice variety of flowers and plants. Inside the home -- it really is cozy! The room is comfortable and has been tastefully decorated and furnished. I loved the hi-speed internet connection! I didn't use it, but there is also a nice flat screen TV. The bed is quite comfy, the water in the shower is nice and hot. A space heater was provided so that I could add a little extra heat if needed. You will have everything you need for a good night sleep and a pleasant stay. Jennifer is a gracious host who will make you feel right at home. "

The room is very clean and cozy with a mini fridge, microwave, tv, dvd, and a VERY comfortable bed. She stays upstairs in the evenings, so its really like you have the place to yourself. Her home is located in a friendly neighborhood a bus ride away from the downtown area. We also spent time in the Alki area which was really fun and not too far from her home. Jennifer had TONS of fantastic personalized reccomendations for us, our only regret is that we didnt have more time to see everything! Thanks Jen :-)"

I wish I could have spent more time getting to know Jenny, and hopefully I will in the future. I will check for availability at Jenny's first before going on any of my trips to Seattle.

All the best traits of her character are hospitality, decency, patience, kindness and understanding! She is so helpful, welcoming, sweet and attentive to details. She supplied me with easiest directions and recommendations. It's so nice of her. She was not only the host she became my friend. I'm so glad.
Jennifer has a nice house, which is located in quite neighborhood on the fresh air. What an amazing place to stay! The house is so warm, adorable and with all the comforts of  home. It's clean, it's easy to cook, to do laundry. I had plenty of space and plenty of privacy.
I really enjoyed staying at Jennifer's house a lot. The room was clean, cozy, and cute, one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I could have easily spent a whole day relaxing in the space. A nice bathroom was attached to it.   Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Everything was perfect. Thank you Jennifer so much!

It takes about a half-hour to get downtown so if you prefer staying quiet place not far from downtown, I strongly recommend this place. "
895435,72743,2/1/2012,571387,"Our stay at Jen's was great! We had just relocated from Michigan and needed a place to stay for a month while we found work and looked for an apartment. It was a nice room with space for our things as well as a useful mini fridge and television. Jen was always friendly and let us use her kitchen to cook, so we didn't have to eat out all the time. She lives in a nice neighborhood with convenient access to everything including downtown."

Excellent hot water pressure in the shower - wish I had that back home.  Most importantly, Jennifer is welcoming, patient, and quick to provide advice on the local area.  She had some most excellent home-made goodies available for breakfast, too.

And if you like popcorn, get a load of her real (working) carnival-style stand-up popcorn machine!"

We had plenty of privacy as well. On top of all that, there were some amazing cookies waiting for us in the room when we got there.

Thank you Jen for making my stay in Seattle even better than I thought it would be."

We packed up our home, loaded it in a moving truck and took off for a trip across the US to end up in Seattle. Not having jobs or a place to call home I came across AirBNB and found Jennifer's page and immediately knew this was where we needed to stay. Leaving the south on 04/01/12 taking a mini vacation across 13 states lol we arrive in at Jennifer's home after we unloaded our truck into storage on 04/09/12. From the very first email from Jennifer we saw us just how amazing she is. Offering suggestions for places to eat, where to look for jobs, and area's to live or not to live lol. After a month we both found jobs, and a new home right here in West Seattle. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Jennifer and her home is both cozy and inviting.  She has become a wonderful friend during the last month. So if you are looking for a place to stay on a short get-a-way to this wonderful city or looking to relocate like we did don't even hesitate about staying with Jennifer.  "

We actually didn't get to check-in until 7:30pm that Friday due to work and travel time. She was kind enough to wait for us because she was trying to catch the snow white and the huntsmen movie on their opening night. My boyfriend and I first experience with bnb is great, he was happy and is glad to have stayed here instead of hotels. Her place was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. The location was very easy to get too and there is not a lot of traffic. I highly recommend Jen's place for future visitors."

Nice to have windows in the room. I was able to get fresh air during the night."

We arrived on the later side and had to be up early, so we didn't get as much time to get to know her as I would have liked, but my husband, baby, and I loved the house and the room. It's evident that she has invested a lot of thought and effort into the room. The little touches like cold water waiting for us in the fridge, oatmeal/tea/coffee ready to for, & a really comfy queen bed made our overnight stay great! "

Some instant oat meal and coffee was provided as breakfast. Bathroom was clean. Though either Jennifer wasn't home when we arrived everything was organised well, we were let in by her tenant who lives in the house, too. The only thing that can be criticized was the new key that didn't turn in the lock very easy. It took us a while to figure out how to open the door. We didn't see Jennifer much cause we were in town a lot and she was busy working, but the few talks to her were nice and she showed much interest in the comfort of our stay. We would come back again.

Nous disposions de la cuisine à notre convenance. Nous avons trouvé Jennifer très agréable, très souriante et de très bon accueil, malheureusement nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de discuter souvent avec elle car nous n'avions pas les mêmes horaires."

Easy to find from main highway and close to shopping and food/drink.  My room was perfect.  Within a couple of blocks is a park with some really nice wooded, walking paths.  Parking is right in front of the house.  After my stay I am probably going to begin a career change by looking for a job at Electronic Arts..."

We had our own microwave and a small fridge and the bed was amazingly comfortable - you don't wanna leave it in the morning! Jennifer was superfriendly and helpful, she gave us a ride to the airport for only $15 which was great. She also had some yogurt and muffins for us when we came back. The neighborhood is safe and very quiet which was great because Seattle seems SO loud! The only thing is it's quite far away from the city and there is nothing around (to go out and grab a quick bite somewhere for example). But the public transportation is really good and the bus goes right to the city center. Overall, the stay was really nice. "

Jennifer will welcome you with a heartwarming smile :)"

She was full of good ideas of things to do and places to go. When we got lost trying to find her house the first night (totally our fault) she was able to talk us in from across the city. The room is just like the photo,well apointed with T.V. fridge and microwave. The famous bed (see other reviews) was very comfy.

In every respect this is what a first time airbnb experience should be like.

Thanks again Jennifer

2264794,72743,9/11/2012,3299405,"When visiting Seattle, my wife and I usually stay with our kids, but they're a little short on room right now. So we searched for a place in West Seattle that wasn't as expensive as a hotel. Jennifer's seemed like a good bet, and indeed it was perfect for us. We got in late and left early each day, and that wasn't a problem for her at all. We did cross paths a couple times, and she seems like someone you'd like to hang with. The bathroom might could use an upgrade, but it was very clean as was everything. Very buttoned down. We'd certainly stay there again."

2565221,72743,10/9/2012,3672595,"I can't say enough how great a host Jen was. She was very accomodating with check in with my flight arriving late in the evening. The room was very nice, as well appointed as any hotel room. West Seattle is a beautiful area with great shopping, restaurants, and outdoor activities. Downtown Seattle is an easy 15 minute ferry or bus ride away. Jen gave excellent suggestions to get my vacation started. Definitely go visit her coffee stand...she is a great barrista and nice to chat with. I highly recommend Jen and her place if you are in the area!"

2844901,72743,11/9/2012,2261043,"Jennifer has a Jewel in her hospitality with her West Seattle home.  She came for me at the airport and we talked all the way home.  The room is spacious, clean, and lovely.  I slept soundly and was rested for a day of adventure and visit.  The bus stop is a short walk from her home and I returned after midnight and felt safe walking home.  I could get around Seattle and return with ease at Jenny's Jewel.  

Jenny took me to her coffee stand, Jenny's Java Joint, and it is classy.  She offers her guests samples and I am dreaming of the eggnog latte and Honey Biscuits.  She has a variety of tea and coffee for guests.

I brought Hatch Roasted Green Chilis and cooked a meal for her. She likes to cook, too, and shares her meals.  What a gracious host!

The guest room has two windows with garden views.  The closet has mirrored doors with room for unpacking.  Three drawers are also available in the TV console that has cable.  A small refrigerator and coffee and tea condiments are available.  You won't go hungry or thirsty at Jenny's.  The bed has the most comfortable mattress.  The bathroom is a short walk from the guest room.  It has both a shower and a bath.  Jenny provides luscious towels.

3002247,72743,12/1/2012,269976,"This was my first experience with AirBnB and I must admit with a big sense of trepidation. However, upon Jenny opening the door, I was warmly greeted and all my fears quickly went by the way side. What started out as a nice place to stay led to us become fast friends and enjoying each others company. Jenny is a woman on the go so those who chose to stay with her (why wouldn't you) just know that for the most part there will be ample time for some alone time and to have the space to yourself. The house is warm and inviting and having a car was most helpful. The bed.....ahhh the bed, was incredibly comfortable and the only thing I can compare it to is the W's heavenly bed. While I am not forgoing hotels completely, this was a great experience and is an especially good service for those on extended stays. Jenny was a superb host, the room was again, warm and inviting completely stocked with coffee, tea, and assorted oatmeals. If able, make the trek down to her coffee shop and be spoiled by her Americanos!!! Next time I am in Seattle on an extended stay, I will be sure to stay with Jen!!! "

Jennifer had the appropriate schedules which helped get us going in the right direction.  We were able to park our car off the street in her driveway, which felt secure.  The bed is so comfortable, and she has an awesome smart TV to watch in the evenings.  Also the baking was awesome:) Thanks Jenn for the great stay."
6513925,72743,8/15/2013,6949495,"I had a really nice time at Jennifer's - the house was immaculate, in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. Jennifer is really cool and genial person.  we got to talk a little bit and even share a PS3 game one late night :-)
The only issue I had was the bus ride which is really close to Jennifer's house - but runs only once or twice an hour at nights and takes 30-40 minutes to arrive downtown.  All in all - not the biggest issue, but if you plan on hanging out late in downtown - take it into consideration.
 I will definitely consider coming back to stay here when I stay in Seattle in the future."

All the groceries I needed are only a few miles away, and Tukwila (full of every store in existence) is right around the corner. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen has everything you may ever need for cooking. 

Jen is very social, cheerful, and loves helping out if you need anything. She'll be around sometimes, and working most of the time, but I never felt ""alone in a strange place."" The internet is FAST, the snacks are plenty, and it's been easy to feel relaxed here while planning what's next. :)"

Before booking I measaged Jen to explain my situation, to make sure she was okay with having a guest who would be there all the time and who would be having visitors. She was very understanding and welcoming, offering to run to the store if I needed something. The house was very comfortable, quiet, relaxing and pleasant, as was the neighborhood. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable. I appreciated having kitchen privileges and being able to watch DVDs in the guest room and on the large TV screen in the living room. It was fun talking with Jen here and there too. She is really friendly, welcoming, and pleasant. I highly recommend her as a host!"

Jennifer immediately made me feel welcome and I felt right at home staying with her. She supplied a small fridge with water and yogurt in the bedroom which was perfect for when I first arrived after traveling for a while. The room was beautifully decorated and the blinds were great for blocking sunlight as I worked nights. The bed was very large and comfy cozy. The house and room were very clean and organized. There was ample closet and storage space. The location was about a 15 minute drive from downtown Seattle/Pikes Place which worked out great! Avoided the crazy city traffic but wasn't too far to visit. The highway was also a five minute drive away and there was a bus line a block away. The yard was adorable with beautiful trees and flowers everywhere. Jennifer has quite a green thumb. She had tomato plants that she grew in her backyard and shared the tomatoes with me. They were so delicious and fresh. Jennifer is also an amazing cook and baker! Oh My God does this woman know how to bake! She was always in the kitchen whipping something scrumptious up and sharing it with me. What a treat that was :) Jennifer herself is a very friendly, high energy, lovely lady. She was forever in a good mood and always eager to help. I cant thank her enough for allowing me to stay in her house with her. Jennifer also allowed my long term boyfriend to visit and he came about once a month. Jennifer was very kind and respectful to both of us.

The king-size bed in the main bedroom could be difficult for an older or mildly disabled person to maneuver - it's low to the floor and you can only get in on one side. The twin beds in the second bedroom are a little short (we are a tall clan:-) but they worked better than a pull-out sofa for the couple of days other family members joined us. The bathroom is nice (all marble with a small Jacuzzi). And an added plus is the washer and dryer right in the apartment. The location was perfect!

22511684,1122236,11/8/2014,23299551,"Autumn was an attentive and gracious host.  

I happened to bring my own pillow, since I'm a rather picky sleeper.  In the rush of getting packed up, I left it in the apartment accidentally!  Autumn came to my rescue and recovered the pillow from the cleaners.  Thanks Autumn! "
22784471,1122236,11/14/2014,3274314,"Great apartment in a quite building, nice view into downtown, and the Cap Hill neighborhood has plenty of restaurants just a few minutes walk away.  The apartment was just as advertised.  Stayed for business and easy access to downtown and freeways.  Having an assigned parking space directly behind the building is a great bonus and well worth the extra few $$.  There is construction directly south and is noticeable during the day, but is supposed to wrap up by the end of Dec '14.  
Autumn was very nice and the check in/out process is very easy.  This place is a great alternative to the downtown hotels.  I will definitely stay here again."
23089862,1122236,11/22/2014,17155925,"The experience was great! Very easy, good communication, great apartment in a good location. Very professional and accommodating - would definitely stay here again!

Thanks!"
23619396,1122236,12/6/2014,1705240,"Autumn was sweet and welcoming and full of great suggestions, including a nearby restaurant, Poppy, which was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The area in Capitol Hill is near Broadway which has some nice restaurants and cafes. However, it is about 1.6 miles to downtown. So if you're like me and you like to walk everywhere this may not be the most convenient location. However, it is nice to be off the main grid and that way you can discover some hidden gems that most tourists don't get to see. But the apartment itself was lovely and modern and super clean. The living room is nice and airy and open to the renovated kitchen. They left a complimentary bottle of wine which was very kind. We had a great time and fell in love with Seattle!"
23791737,1122236,12/10/2014,23617658,"This place was very nice and clean. It had really nice furnishings and was very homely. The location was great. Easy to walk to a bunch of cool areas in Capitol Hill and easy to get on the bus. 

Autumn was very accommodating of our late arrival. I would recommend this place to my friends and stay there if we went back to Seattle. "
23966524,1122236,12/15/2014,1877275,"The bed was ridiculously comfortable and they provided very nice linens. Very close to everything in Capitol Hill... tons of bars and restaurants.  If you have a car, it's definitely worth springing the extra $10 for parking. "
25543677,1122236,1/19/2015,4744032,"Autumn's place was a fantastic home base for a long weekend in Seattle--very clean with everything needed. The location is fantastic--right in the heart of Cap Hill and a 25 minute walk to Pike Place Market. Checking in was easy, and everything was as depicted in the description. Only potential issue for anyone looking to stay in the next few months was some construction going on next door. It didn't wake us up at all, but we're heavier sleepers, so it might bother people who are easily woken up. Otherwise a great option, and we'd definitely stay there again."
26828737,1122236,2/20/2015,9193973,"I was on an extended business trip to Seattle for about 6 weeks and finding this perfectly located pad in Capitol Hill was everything I needed. The neighborhood is clean, quiet, yet there's a lot to do nearby; tons of restaurants, bars, and shops. Autumn and Melissa were extremely responsive and there were no issues when I needed to extend my stay twice more. The price is actually a bargain for the location, apartment size, and parking (+$10/day). Definitely recommend!"
27842829,1122236,3/13/2015,6409851,"I have stayed here multiple times and always been happy with the experience: the place is clean, modern, and comfortable. The location is excellent -- easy walk to restaurants on Broadway and nearby parks."

a problem due to construction next door, something it would
appear Autumn had no control over, she jumped in and fixed it.
Very nice place to stay!

Autumn met us on the evening that we arrived and talked us through the neighbourhood and the apartment which I thought was a really nice touch too."

30720289,1122236,4/26/2015,20708396,"First, the apartment was clean, comfortable and exactly as advertised. The only surprises were pleasant ones. We were visiting our son who lives on Capitol Hill, so the location was ideal for us.
Second, Autumn was an excellent host; she went the extra mile to accommodate an early check-in and late departure."

Surprisingly quiet, too, even though it was near the freeway and in a densely populated neighborhood. We appreciated all the thoughtful touches -- chilled wine on arrival, comfortable bed, quality linens, well-lit bathroom and spacious shower. Autumn and Melissa were absolutely delightful to work with -- super responsive and friendly. We will definitely return! "

I arrived on an earlier flight at Autumn's associate met me earlier to let me in and I was able to use the lockers for early arrival / late departure. Apartment was well stocked with towels and was very clean. Based on the listing ""modern luxury"" I was a little shocked by the outside of the building, but everything was nice when you got inside. Great local recommendations and I was welcomed with a bottle of wine.  Neighborhood is great, walking distance to nightlife and cool restaurants. Way better than staying downtown in a hotel. "

40774767,1122236,8/2/2015,6843711,"The apartment is as described. It was immaculately clean! And quiet! We were in the rear building on the alley, we heard no vehicle noise. No inside noise either until our 4th day, and only 2 quiet cabinet closings. The kitchen had what little we needed during our stay, but appeared well-equipped for real cooking. The king bed was very comfortable, not too firm but not soft. The water pressure was good in the shower. If you have a car, rent a parking space!!! No on-street parking to be seen.  The area is steeply hilly, so if you have mobility issues, this could be a big challenge, as could the 2 flights of stairs to the unit. We felt safe in the neighborhood. The portable air conditioners in the living room and bedroom were much appreciated, as it was hot hot hot when we were there. Note: the blinds are light filtering, not light blocking, so the bedroom is light as soon as the sun comes up. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle."

They recommended me a variety of food to eat in the neighbourhood. And the earlier next morning I was going to catch a flight n they offered me to sleep on the sofa for the night instead of the chair in the airport! That's very touching! Very clean n comfortable place!:)
38310081,6939472,7/14/2015,10934051,I was met at the link rail station and escorted back to the house.  I so appreciate this.  Room was clean and it was quiet.

My room was sufficiently spacious, the bed was comfortable and a nice desk with a reading light was provided. Tissues and bottled water in the room was appreciated. Their home is conveniently located within minutes of the light rail station with equidistant to downtown and SeaTac Airport. A comfortable and pleasant stay at a very fair price. "

42622814,6939472,8/14/2015,39174981,"This is my second time to use AirBnB and I must say that this place is much better than the first. The room is well kept and the whole house is impeccably clean. I am also glad that despite my late arrival, as I have to wait for my luggage at SEATAC, Julian actually waited for me at the train station (this is already around 12:40 AM). This place is a short walk from the train station and about a 20-minute train ride for both the airport and downtown Seattle. Although, I have only stayed at this place for a night, the neighborhood seemed to be safe and I would probably stay here again whenever I am in Seattle-area.

Knowing that it isn't required or expected of them, they even drove me to KIRKLAND...in traffic!!! My room was fresh and clean. My bed and pillows were fresh and super comfortable. First night, hearing people outside my window, I thought that would be a problem, but it seems that the neighbors share a common bedtime. I slept peacefully. Sharing the bathrooms felt like I had my own, as they were always clean and available. The only houseguest who was noisy was me...as one mid-morning I was downstairs singing karaoke and dancing with Jasmine...(so much fun). Some evenings upon my return, I would sit and chat with J & J. They are really good people. Being steps away from the bus and light rail was perfect. On the morning that I was checking out, Julian knocked at my door to say goodbye as he and Jasmine would be leaving the house before me. That was very special to me. I will definitely stay here again and I will recommend to all this stay."

I thought they did so because I had two heavy suitcases, but they even suggested me that they would drive me off where I wanted to buy some stuff. I am an international student and I was quite nervous, but I believe they will treat other people as they did to me if you talk to them. I strongly recommend their place.

As I had lots of used clothes from my trip in other cities to wash, the host didn't hesitate to offer to help me wash. The location was also fantastic. It's not downtown but being two minutes walk to the link light rail it was a breeze to go anywhere or travel to and from airport. I would stay there again."

The room is as it appears in the photo -- it is simple and clean; as is the  rest of the place.

The place is somewhat difficult to locate as Alaska Street and Alaska Place are right next to each other.  A clearer map would  be very helpful."

Overall it was very quiet(as the other guests were respectful), but the walls are thin so you could hear the occasional steps and cough. Julian and his wife were home sometimes during my 5 day stay and they were very nice and helpful. They provide towels, shampoo + conditioner, hair dryer, water, and a few other things. If you check the desk, they even have pamphlets on places to see in the city. The best thing was having the light rail station 3 minutes from the house. Also, the place is very clean! "

If a need would arise, they would be responsive to our call. During our trip, there was a heat wave going through Seattle. While this isn't rare for Chicagoans like us, it apparently was for many residents there. Ben came over with an extra fan for us and checked up to make sure we were comfortable. We're so grateful to have had genuine hosts who want to create a great AirBNB experience for guests! Thanks!"
38010379,6567683,7/12/2015,27902684,"Quiet neighborhood, beautiful view, clean and neat with onsite parking.  The house was very nice-perfect for a small group while still allowing privacy because of the split floor bedrooms with common area in between.  It appeared they might still be working on the unit because it was missing blinds-we had to hang towels on some of the bedroom windows and all the pictures were in a stack in the closet.  Hosts were very responsive to requests for a few missing items if you sent them an E-mail.  They provided recommendation for dinner which turned out well.  Two small things could have made it a perfect experience check-in was a little challenging because I don't have a smart phone and couldn't see all of the text messages they were sending and they don't actually physically answer the phone.  Sofa and bed pillows could have used a little freshening up."

Two bedrooms and baths on separate floors gave us the privacy we both wanted with the kitchen and living room In a floor between us. The fact that it was easy access to downtown Seattle by a quick water taxi was also a bonus, leaving quiet solitude when we came home. It is really close to all things Seattle. Shauna was also quick to respond when needed. "

We enjoyed the kitchen the most because we cooked most of our meals there and had everything we needed including wine glasses and nice quality cooking essentials.  The location was good although a little far to walk to the beach with a 4 year old but not a problem....just a quick drive.  Our daughter ran every morning from the house to the beach and loved the trail.

Desde su balcón se puede ver el ""skyline"" de la ciudad y el resplandor de la misma.
Mis amigos quedaron muy agusto con el lugar, ellos han transcribió esto porque yo soy quien los recomendó a usar AirBnB ya que no tienen aún su cuenta.
Quiero agradecer a Shauna y Ben sus atenciones para con Claudia y Marlos y sus suegros en este viaje a Seattle después de un crucero a Alaska."
43833239,6567683,8/22/2015,212157,"Enjoyed our stay here. The location was convenient for us considering we spent a lot of time on Alki Beach. Only downside that it was a bit too hot the first day. There's a portable AC on the middle floor, but the top floor was pretty warm even with the fan and all the windows open. 

Checking in and out was very easy and the house had everything we needed.  "

Shauna & Ben's place was a perfect fit for our needs! Lots of room, comfortable beds, and a quiet neighborhood. Brunch the next morning was at Salty's on Alki, which was less than a 5 minute drive away, so their townhome was in a very convenient location. We were only there for one night, but if I ever need a place to stay in West Seattle again, I will definitely look up Shauna & Ben's place!"

Their townhouse is perfect for either two couples or a small family.  The townhouse is centrally located and convenient to wherever you want to go in Seattle.  We specifically concentrated in the Alki Beach area as we were attending a wedding and festivities which was only a five minute drive away.  

The townhouse is well kept, has everything you can think of, and very clean which was so important to us, it won't disappoint,  you'll be glad you booked it."

53019880,6567683,11/3/2015,637530,"Minimally decorated 3 story condo.  Two comfortable beds with nice linen, one downstairs and one on the 3rd floor.  The temperature of the bedroom downstairs was cooler on our stay.   I was traveling with my mother in-law and she recommends more dishware for a table setting of 4.  If you are wanting to wash your clothes, there is a note on the washer stating it may rust your clothes.  We rinsed a shirt in the sink and used the dryer.  The condo has a fenced backyard that was great for our dog.  The neighborhood was nice and driving into town was short.    "
54204619,6567683,11/16/2015,44883749,We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a nice note (and I DID indeed drink the wine and watch Netflix on the giant TV  which also features AppleTV with tons of movies on it.) I was happy with the two very separate bedrooms with bathrooms close by. Also our son slept in the third bedroom which is actually a very small laundry room. His play yard fit perfectly well and he had his private area to sleep soundly. It was very close to the freeway and a 4 minute drive to the scenic walk along Alki Beach. We had so much fun staying here. Thank you Shauna and Ben!

The apartment was clean, spacious enough (for a studio), and had amenities like a fully stocked kitchen and Apple TV.  The apartment is in a GREAT location in the heart of Belltown, walking distance to the Pike Place Market and a short cab to Capitol Hill and Downtown.  Cory and Amanda were both very accommodating- we got in late on Friday night and Amanda was happy to meet us there, even at 11pm.  The only small complaint I would have is that the bathroom is very small, especially the shower.  Wasn't a big deal to me and didn't affect my enjoyment of their place in any way, but could be an inconvenience for some.   Would definitely recommend!"

It was nice and warm, water had a good pressure and having a kitchen was a definite plus. We would stay there again.
There where lots of places to eat and go out around. We walked to the market every day and to many attractions as they are very close.
As for the noise: I guess you can hear some but we slept like rocks anyway."

The eclectic style of their place matches the vibe of Belltown precisely, but with extra comfort and warmth enough to combat the occasionally harsh Seattle weather. Would easily come back!"
8014797,1707064,10/12/2013,2734499,"Super awesome landing pad for centrally located Seattle fun. Check in and check out process are easy and smooth. The apartment is right next door to a low-key venue; very convenient for my usual night-cap. The reason for the trip was to see a favorite band at the Showbox. At the show we purchased the LP, and it was great to have a turntable in the apartment to play it! Great Feature. We dined at Pintxo, the restaurant below, which is always a fantastic restaurant serving small plates, wine and cocktails. Cory and Amanda provide a nicely priced dwelling in a happening part of Seattle. They are the perfect hosts and love their city. I will stay again. "
8058684,1707064,10/14/2013,9076746,"This was the perfect apartment to use as a launch pad for visiting Seattle.  The location is perfect to get around to restaurants, shopping, and all the regular tourist things with ease.  The apartment was really great, comfortable, and super cute!  Amanda and Corey were very friendly and they went above and beyond.  This is definitely on our list of places to use again when in town.

The only advice is that if you are looking for quiet nights, the bar next door can be a bit noisy until they close, but it wasn't unbearable and they had fresh earplugs by the bed."

Pike Place Market is a very short walk away. The apartment itself was well designed and spotless. Amanda and Cory were also thoughtful enough to provide earplugs for the lighter sleepers! If I find myself in Seattle ever again, I'll definitely try and get this apartment again. Thanks guys!"
8323031,1707064,10/25/2013,8694011,"Cory and Amanda were great hosts!  Their place is cozy and comfortable - plenty of space for my boyfriend and me, and it was very clean.  The location was awesome - we walked almost everywhere we went, and the few times we took cabs, they were very easy to catch right outside.  It was right near the waterfront and really gave me the feeling of being a Seattle resident, which was the experience I was looking for.  They were also extremely accommodating - although the space wasn't ready when we arrived early for check-in, Cory welcomed us and let us drop off our luggage.  He also let us leave our luggage a little longer when our flight home got delayed which was a huge help!  I would definitely stay with them again when I go to Seattle!"
8697794,1707064,11/12/2013,9336316,"We are actually Seattle locals who were looking to enjoy a staycation in Belltown during a weekend long pinball tournament at the barcade across the street, and Cory and Amanda's place couldn't have been a better fit! Unlike a the many IKEA catalog apartments available on Airbnb, theirs is impeccably decorated with local paintings and photography (including a famous shot of a babyfaced Kurt Cobain), lending it a truly unique and artsy feel. The fully equipped kitchen (with a few starter beverages in the fridge!) is a great way to  save money (and the place is a five minute walk to Pike Place Market!), and then use that money you saved to go all out at Pintxo downstairs, we had a phenomenal brunch!

The apartment is clean as a whistle, and the hosts were more than accommodating to any questions or needs we had. That said, it was all the little extra touches that really made for a fun, nightlife-driven weekend. The excellent cocktail lounge next door was not remarkably noisy, and earplugs were adorably provided at bedside. There was a  record player and small vinyl collection (we got a lot of mileage out of the Footloose soundtrack, most notably an epic recreation of the ""Kevin Bacon Angry Dance"" after we were both eliminated from the tournament). A beautifully pre-set table made for a nice dinner for two, and there are dozens of great bars up and down the street. For our inevitable recovery day, the flat was isolated from street noise, and well stocked with interesting books and magazines. That combined with a great bed, Netflix, and a shower stall that's perfect for one to slump on the floor of letting the hangover wash off - we had it made. We'll be recommending it to everyone who visits, and certainly be vacationing in Belltown again soon!"

I would definitely stay there again!!!!"
8873938,1707064,11/23/2013,9840644,"Great location! Easy to walk all around the central market and waterfront, up to Paramount Theatre, main shopping streets, lots of restaurants. The entrance to the apartment is clean and safe. FUNKY stairs and landing especially since both the apartment door and the cocktail lounge door are side by side. I enjoyed the music and chatter coming from the lounge - friendly and unique - never heard a rowdy moment and didn't keep me awake (ear plugs are provided but I didn't use any). The apartment is very cozy, nicely laid out, and clean. Dishes are well stocked and Cory/Amanda left us orange juice, fresh milk, tea/coffee and ginger beer. Bathroom is small and functional (the shower head could be stronger). Great heat supply (and we were in a cold snap!) and if it's too hot, the radiator valve can be adjusted. Bed and pull out couch are very comfortable with good sheets.  Enjoyed the record player, flat screen TV with Netflicks, fun art, and high ceilings. Some natural light, no view but dark and very little traffic noise at night.   Definitely would return!"

Even though I was next door to a lounge bar, I was never bothered and the noise level was never outrageous. I slept without earplugs. Amanda and Cory are a simple text or call away for anything.

There is acutally a Speakeasy right next door which was a very cool way to end the evenings and the sound was never too bad at all.

They left us cream, and everything set up to make coffee or tea upon our arrival. We stayed for a week and were never in need of anything - the apartment was very clean and comfortable; everything was provided (even a hairdryer, which I forgot!) The bar next door didn’t disturb us at all and they left ear plugs for us as well. The restaurant downstairs (Pintxo) is phenomenal, we ate there more than once. 
Their place is in a great location, we didn’t need to take a cab once during our stay, they were walking distance to almost every major neighborhood/area (Seattle ctr, downtown, pioneer sq, capitol hill, centrally located in Belltown) and literally just a few minutes from the waterfront & Pike Place Market. They’re on the same block as a lot of landmark restaurants/bars in Belltown as well. I highly recommend them as hosts and their location to stay when visiting Seattle!

18782764,1707064,9/1/2014,13500828,Great location! Amanda was very helpful and easy to contact. Happy with our stay and would stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!
18952281,1707064,9/3/2014,14518606,"I had a great stay at Amanda and Cory's apartment. It is just as it looks in the pictures and they provided lots of information on their favorite local bars and restaurants which was really useful - I felt totally at home! They also were really helpful in making suggestions for hikes and other local things to do (I had a great day at Bumbershoot - thank you :-)) and also advising me not to bike in town unless I was a seasoned city biker. They really look out for their guests. Belltown is a great location, it's easy to get to Pike Place Market and also to a number of other sights but at the same time, it's just a great neighbourhood to hang out in. "
19018165,1707064,9/4/2014,4830395,"In arranging the stay, I was met with very quick response from Amanda and Cory; very pleasant and informative.   The arrangement to get access to the apt was easy.  I loved the place.  It was clean and had awesome location and character.  Bed was nice; everything worked.  The sink and shower are pretty tight but that's part of the character.  Was in town for a show at the Crocodile so you can't get much better. I will look here first when staying in Seattle again.  "
19195657,1707064,9/8/2014,13961508,"We had a great stay at C & A's studio apartment. Our hosts were really cool- they are quick to answer questions and made us feel very welcome. They even went the extra mile to print suggestion lists. The space is cozy comfort, just as described. It was clean and very well appointed with everything from towels to filtered water cooling in the fridge. The 2nd Street location could not be better. It's an easy walk to see, shop, dine or drink in every direction. Only stay here if you want to be smack in the middle of the festivities Belltown has to offer! "
19360947,1707064,9/11/2014,8070102,"The studio was cozy and clean, exactly same as in the pictures. It had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. Location is perfect! Near all the nice bars and restaurants and also the lovely seawall. Cory and Amanda had left us some good tips for eating outside. Thanks guys!"
19671231,1707064,9/16/2014,8292818,"Location is great to stay and enjoy nightlife as Belltown has lots of restaurants and bars. And their restaurant is absolutely nice to have small plates as like tapas. 
Although some noisy sound from next bar, it doesn't matter if you enjoy night life and sleep late during your trip. I went the bar two times!

House is really well equipped to feel like my room.  Amanda is helpful and delight woman I think. I wish I would stay again if I visit Seattle definitely!
Hope so.

19782665,1707064,9/18/2014,17616126,"Amanda and Cory are great hosts and accommodated us arriving early afternoon and also arranged for us to store or luggage on the day of departure. The apartment was fab, trendy and in a great location. Would 100% recommend to any one having a break in Seattle."
19926967,1707064,9/21/2014,17261854,"If you want to be downtown where all the action is, this is the place to stay!  Apartment is right next door to ""The Upstairs"",  a great place to relax and have a drink.  Down side is a little bit of noise late into the night, but worth it for the location downtown.  We would stay again.  "
20014142,1707064,9/22/2014,387441,"We had a great time in Cory and Amanda's adorable apartment. The location and neighborhood are wonderful. 

But if you are driving a car beware that there is no free parking anywhere and time limits are strictly enforced. Reserve a spot with the hosts prior to arriving. "
20114490,1707064,9/23/2014,4265618,"Cory and Amanda were great hosts! They were very friendly when we met them, and were graciously flexible with our check-in and check-out times. My sister had asked UPS to deliver her passport to the apartment, and Cory was nice enough to make a sign for the deliveryperson to make sure we got it! 

The studio was roomy enough for three people. Since the apartment is long, it felt like there were different spaces for the living room, bed and kitchen area. 

We did hear sounds at night from the bar next door and the entryway, so this might not be the place for you if you are an extremely light sleeper. However, with earplugs in, I slept fine. 

The location is great! Very central, near restaurants and bars and coffeeshops. Close to the water. We walked to Pike Place Market."
20190469,1707064,9/25/2014,3121376,This is a best place to stay in Seattle. If you love food it perfect for stay. We have a good time to eat and drink even next door have a good cocktail.

20559370,1707064,10/1/2014,19697063,"Amanda and Cory we're great! Really easy to communicate with and gave us great reccomendations. The apartment was clean, and just as it appears in the photos. Perfect for what we needed and we were shocked at how amazing the location is. You are on a street with endless bars and restaurants yet it isn't loud and crowded like the rest of downtown. It was an amazing stay!"
20636575,1707064,10/2/2014,12399892,"Cory and Amanda gave a very warm welcome to my first trip into Downtown Seattle! They were both very hospitable and had great communication before and during my stay in their delightful home. Do not have any hesitation in booking this place if you want to be immersed in a living, breathing, and vibrant downtown Seattle scene that offers a great perspective into city life in the Pacific Northwest.

20747484,1707064,10/5/2014,11979382,"Loved the apartment- The hosts were great and made everything easy. You can't best the location- right in the middle of the best part of Seattle.
The apartment does share a wall with a bar, and we were there for Friday Saturday nights, but we were not bothered by the proximity.

20890043,1707064,10/6/2014,8289371,"In it's own merit, this place was awesome! It had a unique 70's feel to the place. It included all the necessities you need for a simple and comfortable stay. The old-age building, located right next to a bar, studio arrangement of the place, dinner table for two, made for a fun night."
20987603,1707064,10/9/2014,17674791,"What a great place to stay in Seattle! Corey an Amanda were easy and prompt with all communication and hospitality. We felt very much at home. The location is prime, a walking distance to Pike Place Market, waterfront, downtown, many wonderful bars and restaurants. After a long day of gallivanting, it was good to come back to this place, not to mention that there's a bar right outside our door!"
21278375,1707064,10/14/2014,17381466,"We stayed at Corey and Amanda's apartment for four nights and thought they were great hosts - great communication leading up to and during the stay. The apartment was clean, comfortable and very well-located with respect to the various sights. The hosts were quick with restaurant recommendations, and we also appreciated that they let us store our bags in their restaurant since we arrived much earlier than check-in time. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay, but I do want to mention that the upstairs bar is literally right beside the apartment and is considerably noisy at times (evening hours only). It was fine for our needs because we were out and about the majority of every day and evening, but earplugs were definitely required for sleeping if you retire before the bar closes (the hosts provide earplugs). While it was no problem for us, it should be noted for those who are concerned about peace and quiet."
21349843,1707064,10/15/2014,21446880,"Had a fantastic experience with Cory and Amanda in their adorable downtown apartment. The place was immaculate set up with great amenities for travelers - like brochures on where to explore around the city and maps on how to get there.

Location is fantastic - walking distance to pikes market, the needle, everywhere. Had a great night!! "
21461397,1707064,10/18/2014,19447645,Great location in a very happening area of Seattle. The apartment is quite roomy for a studio and very comfortable. Perfect place if you really want to take advantage of Seattle's nightlife. 
21655434,1707064,10/21/2014,1725213,This apartment was in the heart of it all! Close to all the best restaurants and bars the city has to offer. Only a 10 minute walk to the light rail to get to/from the airport. 15 minute walk to the space needle and the chihuly mueseum. 'The Upstairs' whiskey bar right next door is a wonderful place for a nightcap. Could be a little loud for a light sleeper but Amanda and Cory provide earplugs. This apartment is an absolute diamond and we can't wait to return to Seattle and we will definitely be contacting Amanda and Cory about renting again! 
21769789,1707064,10/23/2014,22027248,"This was our first AirBnB stay and Cory and Amanda were patient, welcoming and helpful! The location was exactly what we needed. We had to arrive late and leave early because we had an event - wish we could have stayed longer!"
21870395,1707064,10/26/2014,9341010,"We arrived a bit earlier than the check-in time but Amanda graciously let us check-in early which was greatly appreciated! The place is easy to find, and I found the fact that they owned the bar and restaurant next to the place awesome. (Of course we checked both out, the tapa place was delicious! Definitely get there during happy hour too!!) 

99% of the places and things we wanted to see and do were within walking distance. They recommended to us a couple places to watch football and both were super close and exactly what we were looking for.

The place itself is very cute and eclectic. It had all the amenities we needed, and they even provided umbrellas which were a must through the weekend! I would say the only con I would have is the noise being that the bar shares walls with the place, but it's fully disclosed on their airbnb site that it's part of it and honestly it was a non-issue for us! Besides that, this is in the perfect location to do the major site seeing one would want to do in a weekend, the place was lovely and the owners were great!"
22145629,1707064,10/31/2014,709867,"We had a fantastic experience at Cory and Amanda's place. We were traveling in by train (Amtrak) and had a 17 hours delay ... meaning that we were arriving in the middle of the night but nevertheless Cory was there to greet us and explain the in's and out's of the apartment and neighborhood. The apartment itself is roomy and comfortable ... all amenities are available and the location is absolutely great. Walking distance to the most interesting neighborhoods of Seattle. Lots of restaurants and bars literally in front of the apartment and around the corner. We were there on weekdays so it was relatively quiet but I could imagine that on weekends it gets a little noisier. There are earplugs on the nightstand ... so use them! Communication with the hosts was an absolute pleasure ... quick, helpful and understanding."
22397067,1707064,11/5/2014,18281305,"The apartment was perfect for our weeklong conference stay. Amanda and Cory and their amazing staff at Pintxo and the Upstairs made our stay a great experience. The apartment had many amenities that made it feel like 'home' and Amanda and Cory even brought an extra item for us on request. The description of the apartment on Airbnb is spot on and it is well worth the price, plus you get to experience the city differently than you would in a regular hotel. If you stay, take advantage of the delicious cocktails and tapas and make sure you walk one block to Bedlam Cafe for a lavender mocha!"
22535131,1707064,11/9/2014,8303184,We had a great time at the Upstairs Airbnb! Cory and Amanda were extremely responsive and great to work with. They made the entire process seamless and smooth. They were also very flexible and accommodating for our check in/checkout time. The apartment was in a great location and was a really unique and authentic way to experience Seattle. 
22579936,1707064,11/10/2014,5393176,"It was a great place. We were there just for the night, but the bar on the other side of the wall was great. I love that they provided ear plugs, but the noise from the bar added to the ambiance. It was very accessible to Pike Place Market and downtown shopping. My husband and I loved it! Thanks Cory & Amanda."
22749323,1707064,11/13/2014,23354993,"I was in Seattle for a few days with a friend and this Belltown apartment was the perfect place to stay. The neighborhood is great with several bars, restaurants, and cafes on every block. The Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and downtown shopping are all within walking distance. Other great neighborhoods like Ballard and Capitol Hill were just a short and inexpensive Uber ride away. My main correspondence was with Cory, who was very kind and accommodating. We couldn't have asked for a better stay."
22825125,1707064,11/16/2014,9265303,"The place was great. Definitely grab a bite at Pintxo and a drink at The Upstairs. We ran into Cory a couple of times and he always had a great recommendation for our next adventure. Thank you for the hospitality, Cory & Amanda."

The location is great, near a lot of great bars and restaurants (read their recommended restaurants list on the coffee table). The bar noise next door is noticeable, but we didn't lose any sleep over it. Would definitely stay there again. "
23549531,1707064,12/4/2014,7702426,"Great place! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Loved the bar and the restaurant. We didn't have any trouble with noise because we were in town to see a concert and the bar was actually closed when we got back to the apartment. The layout of the space was great, the bed is super comfortable, and we especially enjoyed being able to plug our ipod into a nice stereo system. We didn't cook much but it looked like the kitchen had everything you'd need. We appreciated the water filter and the french press. Highly recommend Cory & Amanda's place!"
23632728,1707064,12/7/2014,22856666,"Cory & Amanda's apartment was amazing & a great use of a relatively small space. Perfect for a couple that's into the downtown Seattle nightlife. If you like the idea of sharing a wall with a really cool bar, this place is for you. "
23776203,1707064,12/9/2014,16729586,"We did not get a chance to meat Amanda during our short stay. Cory was friendly, very flexible for our last minute schedule change, and made us feel welcome. The location is indeed perfect for nightlife and enjoying the pike market and the space needle. We appreciated the parking space available and to be able to leave our luggage at the restaurant after check out to continue enjoying the city. The only downside is the noise from the bar that may keep you up if you cannot use earplugs comfortably or want to go to bed before midnight. That being said, as long as your are prepared for this, this place is very convenient.  Thank you Cory and Amanda.
"
23865479,1707064,12/13/2014,14847183,"What an amazing place!  Perfect location to walk to Pike Place, Space Needle, and the shops downtown and close to all of the public transit options.  Pintxo has great food right downstairs and the atmosphere at The Upstairs is fantastic.  Cory & Amanda leave ear plugs for guests, but the noise from the bar didn't bother us one bit.  Apartment was clean and had everything we possibly needed, including a washer and dryer.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Everyone was very welcoming and the location was central to food , night life , space needle , west lake etc. The bar was right next to the room but we were so wiped out from daily activities that we didnt mind the noise at all. The property was very clean and had all the ammenities you would need , even a fully stocked kitchen which we didnt get a chance to use. We will deffinitely stay here again ! "
24383306,1707064,12/27/2014,15904912,"My family and I had a great time! The host was very responsive in making sure everything was going well. The noise from the bar wasn't a bother, since we weren't at the place for most of the time it was open. The location was great. A short walk or Uber ride got us around all the places we wanted to visited.  Definitely recommend this place! "
24643762,1707064,1/1/2015,11266858,"Cory & Amanda's upstairs apartment was close enough to Pike Place to get the experience and far enough to get away from the crowd of tourists. Their restaurant downstairs is awesome! The tapas ate unique and very well executed. They also make an awesome Moscow Mule. The Upstairs bar has a great vibe and prohibition style drinks. The apartment is adjacent to the bar, but we were not once bothered by the noise! The kitchen is clean and equipped for cooking. There is a nice stereo and Apple TV. It was a very nice stay! "

The only downside was that it is right beside a bar which is super noisy as bars are. It didn't bother us much but if you're a light sleeper it's probably not a great for for you. I would definitely stay here again if I were back in Seattle. 
25714201,1707064,1/24/2015,19012564,"The positive experience with Cory and Amanda started before we even arrived. Although their place is very close to many downtown destinations, they recommended against taking Link into the city after our 10 p.m. arrival.

Checking in (and out) was a very easy process. The place was spacious for a studio, clean and very well-appointed, and even had a hair dryer, soft drinks and water (website hidden) noise, while present, was not a factor at any point. (Wed. - Fri.)"
25768914,1707064,1/25/2015,9308817,"The apartment is ideally located in the Belltown section of Seattle, near to many restaurants, music venues etc.  Inside, everything is neat and clean and well thought out, from the whistling teapot to the provided coffee to the filtered water in the fridge.  We lacked for nothing and had a most comfortable overnight stay. 

Highly recommended and the owners were most accommodating and responsive to communications.  Our only regret was that this was just a quick overnight due to our schedule and we didn't have lots of time to just relax and enjoy the space and the neighborhood.  

Parking is street or lot; we had no problem finding an overnight lot within a block or so over on 1st Avenue.

They helped us with suggestions for transportation, restaurants, and even allowed us to store our bags for part of the last day so we could enjoy every minute of our trip. I felt welcome and comfortable texting them with questions and for help. Even their employees at the restaurant (Pintxo) and The Upstairs were kind, courteous and helpful, making us feel even more at home. The apartment is in the most ideal location. We were able to walk to every site we were hoping to see and even found a ton more to see and enjoy in the neighborhood that we didn't even know we'd find! The apartment itself was adorable, comfortable and had every amenity we needed...and then some! Cory and Amanda have thought of everything! I plan on staying here on my next visit (visits) to Seattle, and would highly suggest it to anyone traveling and site seeing in Seattle. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.

It is indeed right next to a bar upstairs, and at night on the weekend you can hear the music and activity almost as if you were in the bar itself.  We tended to stay up late so it wasn't a problem, but it's good to consider.  The location was perfect as it is within walking distance of so many coffee shops, restaurants, and attractions.  Amanda met us at the apartment on our first day, and the staff of the Upstairs Bar and Pintxo downstairs were also very friendly and helpful when we had questions.  Highly recommended!"
26397562,1707064,2/11/2015,6946069,"What an amazing place! Setting everything up with Amanda was easy and Cory was very friendly when we met so I could pick up the keys. He gave us a lot of great tips for our one night in Seattle! We also liked the access to the parking space. Both Cory and Amanda were very accessible too.

Our favorite part of this place was The Upstairs bar next to the apartment. We were only in town for the evening before catching a flight and it was the perfect place to settle in for the night after some barhopping-- just a quick walk next door. The drinks were phenomenal and the atmosphere was chill--great music choices too. We didn't get to try the restaurant downstairs because we got back too late, but you can bet we'll be there the next time we visit! "
26451161,1707064,2/13/2015,11443784,Everything was great. The apt is just like the pictures.They responded very quickly. The apartment is centralized and a couple min to EVERYTHING. We met Cory when we received the keys he was very informative and let us know about a couple places to visit. Overall we would definitely stay at c&a place again if we had the pleasure to revisit this beautiful city! 
26518255,1707064,2/15/2015,12515278,"This darling apartment was the perfect base for our weekend in Seattle. It is absolutely central to all the best that Seattle has to offer--Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and amazing restaurants and music venues. We parked our car and walked everywhere! The apartment was cozy and clean, very cool artwork and lots of information on what to do in Seattle. We met Cory on check-in and he had great suggestions about what to do on our first night (karaoke at Hula Hula!); we also ran into both Amanda and Cory throughout the weekend and they were super gracious and friendly. 

If you stay here I definitely recommend making reservations at Pintxo, and save some room in your budget for The Upstairs--incredible drinks, awesome atmosphere. The only drawback to the apartment sharing a wall with The Upstairs is the noise level; but the hosts provide ear plugs and that worked fine for me. If you are an early-to-bed, light-sleeper kinda person, this might not be the right place for you to stay. We will definitely consider staying here again the next time we visit Seattle!"
26680441,1707064,2/17/2015,19939696,"Absolutely loved this little gem of a place! The neighborhood was perfect; tons of shops, bars and restaurants. Everything you want to see to play tourist is within walking distance. And we felt safe everywhere we went which I think is important when you're far away from home! We will definitely be back."
26890815,1707064,2/21/2015,27690494,This place was awesome! It was a great location right in the middle of Belltown walking distance to  anything you desire. The bar right next door provided the perfect atmosphere for when I got back at night to relax and meet Seattle locals to learn about the town. The place had a lot more space then I expected from the pictures. The bed was comfy with tons of blankets and pillows. The shower was nice and hot. I was there for work so I didn't spend much time in the place but it was still great. I definitely will stay here again next time I come to town. 
27048858,1707064,2/24/2015,1020576,"Cory and Amanda were fantastic hosts! They openly communicated with us each step of our trip, which made arrival very easy. Check-in wasn't until 4pm, but they allowed us to drop off our bags early so we could enjoy the city. They also left a list of suggestions for local restaurants, bars and shops. The neighborhood is great - very lively at all hours of the day and night, but it wasn't disturbingly loud. We were able to grab a drink and dinner at 10pm on a Monday night just across the street from the apartment, which was great as we were trying to spend as much time as possible exploring the city.

The bed in the apartment is ridiculously comfortable! I think almost every night we came in and passed out within seconds :) The bar next door never posed an issue for us in terms of noise. However, my boyfriend and I are pretty heavy sleepers. For the lighter sleepers, there is a shot glass of earplugs by the bedside. The unit was a bit cold (our stay was in mid-February), but they have an electric space heater for when the radiator just isn't doing the trick. 

The unit is a studio, and I think that's important for future guests to remember that this is a studio, and the space is small. There isn't much room to hang clothes - maybe about eight hangers. The bathroom is also very tiny - I was bumping my elbows while washing my hair. 

Overall, we loved our stay - the apartment came equipped with everything we needed and was adorably decorated! We were so tired each night that we never had a chance to try their bar next door, ""The Upstairs,"" but it looked fun! We had dinner at ""Pinxto"" downstairs one night, and that was delicious!"
27200570,1707064,2/28/2015,24948934,"What a great location to stay at! Steps from Pike Place market and only minutes to lots of great places to eat and drink. The apartment has everything you would need and Cory and Amanda are great hosts. The only warning I have is that the bar next door, which serves great cocktails, gets loud at night so it may be a problem if you're a light sleeper or you can't tolerate earplugs. Otherwise, no complaints!"
27694831,1707064,3/9/2015,16790005,"We arrived at a pretty busy time for the restaurant downstairs so we didn't have much interaction with Cory or Amanda.  However, they were very responsive and accommodating.  The apartment was very nice and everything was as advertised.  The location is particularly great and you can walk anywhere in the city within minutes.  

The only thing I would mention, which others have noted as well, is that the apartment shares a wall with the upstairs bar.  Saturday night was pretty loud but we are relatively heavy sleepers.  If you are a light sleeper, you might want reconsider.  The staff in the bar and the restaurant downstairs were awesome.  We would definitely stay there again!!

27803916,1707064,3/12/2015,17942836,Cory and Amanda are Airbnb pros.  The apartment is even cozier than photos. Each light is on a dimmer. Wall covered in interesting art. Incredibly comfortable bed. Netflix on a giant flat screen TV. Well-equipped kitchen with coffee and creamer. So many nice touches. The apartment is literally next door to the bar and you can hear low voices and clinking glasses. I liked that. Ideal location. Go to Shorty's across the street for beers and pinball. Blocks from Pike Place. Highly recommended. 
28089920,1707064,3/17/2015,4612040,"If you are looking for an urban city escape in the middle of a ""foodie"" town, this place is PERFECT! We stayed for 5 days and loved this stylish flat.  Immaculately clean. Great location in the center of Beltown (walk to everything) but yet very private. Thoughtful hosts provided everything we needed (plus extras too: Netflix, laundry detergent, blowdryer, umbrellas, etc). It rained for 2 straight days while we were there and it was nice to simply do a load of laundry and have fresh clean dry clothes again. Future renters should be aware this block becomes super trendy on the weekends so the noise level gets higher. No problem for us though, we were active participants and enjoyed the music! The hosts Amanda and Cory were very welcoming. Amanda, especially always greeted us with a huge smile. The location is easy to get to using public transportation from the airport (light rail). We arrived 1 hr prior to check in and they let us store our bags so we could continue exploring the city. Pike's Place Market only 2 blocks away. Lots of food choices for every budget. There is an overbundance of microbreweries and you can get a great cup of coffee just about anywhere. Highly recommended. "
28525611,1707064,3/25/2015,17427231,"The hosts were fantastic in providing info about food and bars in the area. They were exceptionally responsive to inquires and and very helpful in working around my constantly changing check-in time. The place itself was a bit older than I expected from the pictures but it did not impact our stay. I wish the record player was out so I could relax to some music but the stereo provided did the trick. We had three total and were staying almost a full week. This studio apt is definitely more suited for two people, especially for that length of time, but the hosts did a great job of preparing for three people. 
The noise was quite excessive on the weekend because the longest wall is shared with a bar. Music was the main culprit for the loss of sleep but the people were relatively considerate. During the week there was not much noise at all and the ear plugs certainly helped.
All in all, the place was very well located and provided the needed amenities for a more lengthy stay but the noise was certainly a factor and the space could be updated. I left satisfied with my stay!  "
28628509,1707064,3/27/2015,6320943,"This place was everything I imagined an Airbnb would be: funky, quirky, fun, very clean, full of great art. It's in a great neighborhood with many, many great bars, restaurants, etc. and an easy walk to Pike Place and all the downtown attractions.

It's worth noting that one of the aforementioned funky bars does share a wall with the bedroom. This was not a problem for us (we're heavy sleepers, and we just went next door to enjoy the bar--which is a deeply cool establishment and should not be missed). But anyone hoping to hit the hay early should consider this; you will hear the music from next door (earplugs were thoughtfully provided).

The hosts were super accommodating and flexible--cool folks. We would have no problem recommending this place to friends (in fact already have)."
28693728,1707064,3/29/2015,1423799,"Our stay at Cory & Amanda's listing was fantastic! The location was incredible, my wife and I found ourselves walking distance from everything that we wanted to do during our stay, and we were even closer to a lot of fantastic restaurants. Our hosts were very attentive to our needs, and our stay was certainly one to remember."
29065567,1707064,4/3/2015,22883855,"Cory and Amanda's place was yet another home-run in Seattle Airbnb experiences for me. I hadn't explored Belltown, and I would now confidently say theirs is probably the most unique way to do it. I felt immediately welcomed by The Upstairs check-in process, and the restaurant below was dangerously convenient.  Their studio is clean and well-furnished with any small amenity I could have needed. "
29235170,1707064,4/5/2015,3396194,"Hello All! I want to thank Cory and Amanda for hosting me the last weekend. Everything was very easy. They have a little 2-pager with all the instructions and information and everything works. The apartment is really nice, the location is very convenient. You'll find all you need  (towels, sheets, etc) and the sofa opens up and you get a second bed (I'm sure that is also listed). As the posting said, the apartment is literally next door form a bar but don't be worried because it is not loud, and if for some reason you needed complete silence, there are earplugs in the nightstand and that will completely do it. There is even an Apple TV! I will gladly return! Very happy with my stay."
29513101,1707064,4/8/2015,6887625,"Cory and and Amanda are great hosts, very responsive and helpful at all times. The apartment is cozy and very well located with everything needed to feel at home. "

The bed is ridiculously comfortable and the apartment has all the amenities one could ask for. The bar next door is so cool, a great spot for a quick drink! As a light sleeper, I was a little nervous about the noise, but Cory & Amanda think of everything   - ear plugs by the bed and just like that, I didn't hear a peep. Highly, highly, highly recommend! I would stay here again in a minute!"
29899194,1707064,4/13/2015,8366722," The apartment was neat and well located in the middle of Belltown - a quick walk to the fish market, the space needle, and other attractions. The hosts were very responsive and flexible about the checkout time (they didn't have a guest that evening so they offered me a later checkout if i wanted it).

It's not really the host's fault, but the speakeasy next door was quite loud until about 3am even on Sunday night. It was especially bad my first night when there was a private party going on (screaming, loud dance music, general drunken disorderliness.. and I couldn't even pop over for a drink!)  If you plan on going to bed early or are a light sleeper, probably not the best place (there were ear plugs in a cup by the nightstand though, a nice touch!)

The studio is exactly as advertised. Lots of cool art in the room, bed was comfortable, everything that we needed was there. The bar is two steps away which made it very easy to grab a night cap to end each night. This was our first visit to Seattle, but I have to say I couldn't imagine staying in a better location. The Pike Public Market and Space Needle were all within walking distance and the area was filled with great places to eat and lots of night life. We were extremely satisfied with our visit and would love to go back!  "

Cory and Amanda were incredibly helpful and responsive with everything. When the hot water wasn't working for us, they got it working that night! The bar does get noisy, but it wasn't a problem for us since we were so tired from sight seeing we fell asleep almost right away. They also provide earplugs just in case. A really lovely experience for our time in Seattle. Thanks so much!"

Had everything we needed in the cozy space. Conveniently located to neighbourhood and downtown attractions and the bar next door. Cocktails were excellent and the noise was mostly background. It is a bit louder on weekends but we knew that going in. We recommend the apartment, the hosts and the brass knuckles from the Upstairs bar."

The apartment itself is very cute and comfortable. I saw that other people had mentioned that they could hear the noise from the bar, but I couldn't hear anything once I turned on this little white noise machine they have on the night stand, which was great! Overall, I really loved the location and space, and would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."

Everything we were interested in was a short walk away.  Also Amanda was helpful when we needed a place to stow our bags between checking out and our flight, she had to get the apartment ready for the next guests but made sure we didn't have to drag our luggage around with us all day downtown."
33100013,1707064,5/25/2015,29788677,"This apartment is centrally located and easily accessible to attractions like pike market, etc. Our hosts, Amanda and Cory, were very kind to house our luggage earlier than the check in time. Left my earbuds at the apartment and they kept it for my friend to collect it at his convenience which was great.

This apartment is located beside a bar, although the walls are relatively soundproof but occasionally patrons will be talking along the stairways that is audible behind our closed door. However, that didn't bug us.

The decor of the apartment was very unique and enjoyed what they did with the place. Overall, our experience was good and our hosts were prompt with their replies which is very important."
34059520,1707064,6/4/2015,2507102,Lovely spot as a jumping off point for wandering around the city and getting to the Bell Conference Center. Very easy check in and out as well as communication up to the stay.

We could hear it but did not keep us awake. Great food and coffee options all around, walking distance. Try Local 360 for farm to table type experience, especially Sunday brunch. Tapas place below apartment also nice experience. Also not too far from ferry ports. Apartment is typical downtown/small. But great for two of us. "

Amanda made everything easy and was flexible in accommodating our arrival plans.  Their cozy apartment is as described and has all of the great touches that you find in hotels.  They have really thought of everything!

Cory and Amanda were quick to answer any and all question and we felt very welcome when we arrived.  The apartment is on the second level and shares a stairway with a small lounge, which is directly next door.  We stayed over a Saturday night and the lounge was open until 2:00am and while we heard people coming and going, it was never overly noisy or disruptive.  "

The Belltown neighborhood is buzzing with energy, and it was so much fun to stay in the middle of it—We had a lot of things on our to-do list and were able to walk just about everywhere from here.

Apartment well equipped with everything you need, toiletries, coffee, not that you want to eat in with all the great places in the neighborhood. Cory and Amanda we're very accommodating letting us check in early and out late if needed depending on when next guest arrive. They also kept in touch making sure all went smooth.

Also thank you to the hosts for being understanding of little mistakes I made due to being a first time airbnb user. Very generous and fast&easy communication! Would highly recommend the place for younger folks as it is right in the middle of the bar scene and great food places. "

The apartment is situated directly above Amanda and Cory's Spanish restaurant Pintxo, and next door to their bar, The Upstairs. How convenient!

It's well-situated in Belltown, surrounded by lots of great bars and restaurants and close to a lot of the tourist destinations that you might like to visit, such as the Seattle Art Museum, the Experience Music Project, the Space Needle, etc. The apartment itself is cozy and fun, with lots of great paintings and funky furnishings. It's a second floor studio apartment, perfect for 1-2 people. The kitchen is fully stocked (not that you'd necessarily want to cook, given the amazing food culture in Seattle!), and the bathroom has all of the necessities that you forgot to pack. The apartment is located next door to a cool, laid-back bar called The Upstairs (owned by the hosts), and while you can hear a bit of noise, the a/c unit (or white noise machine, if it's not hot out) covered it up well enough. Neither of us had any problem sleeping. We got into town a bit late, so Cory and Amanda left the keys with their bartender. Checking in was totally painless and easy, and we found the apartment clean and welcoming. Cory hooked me up with some great restaurant and neighborhood recommendations, and he and Amanda went truly above and beyond when they noticed that our car had a flat, even going so far to bring in an air compressor to blow it back up. You guys are the best, thank you for a great stay!! "

If you stay with them, it is a MUST DO. The food and drinks were fantastic and Amanda served us that evening. We had a wonderful time learning about their menu from her and about her suggestions for Seattle. We loved their home and their kitchen (naturally) was outfitted with everything you need to cook. We had a great time.

We got to Seattle earlier than expected and texted Amanda about our early arrival. She was very quick to respond and made it possible for us to drop off our luggage at the apartment, despite the fact that we got there several hours prior to the actual time of check-in. She was extremely nice and helpful, we felt very welcome right from the start.

The apartment is extremely clean, spacious and has everything you need for your home base to discover Seattle. In a really nice touch, the coffee table is stocked with guide books to use during your stay. 

In terms of its location, you would be hard pressed to find a better spot to start exploring Seattle's famed public market, the harbor and Belltown, and the Seattle Center. In addition, Cory and Amanda run a great restaurant just downstairs, and there is also a bar right next to the apartment for weary travelers to have a cold drink after a long day of walking around Seattle. It really is a pretty cool setup.

One note regarding the bar: If you are a very light sleeper and / or are in Seattle to go to bed early, this might not be your ideal place. The bar is right next door to the apartment, and you can hear people and music from the apartment. That being said, the place didnt get very crowded, loud or crazy two out of three nights we stayed.

On our first night, the noise was present until after 2am, which was unfortunate. However, we want to stress that when we asked Amanda about this the morning after, she apologized right away, reached out to the bartender and made sure that this remained an exception. She even gave us a bottle of wine as an apology for the inconvenience!  

Overall we want to stress how Amanda was always super quick to respond to any questions or concerns, she was helpful, nice and took care of all our needs. The set up is very professional, the apartment is beautiful and the location is unbeatable. I

The location in the middle of Belltown could not have been better - we walked everywhere and didn't need to take an Uber or taxi once.  There is definitely noise from the bar next door in the evenings, but not even close to something that would've bothered us, and our thoughtful hosts had a noise machine and earplugs by the bed in case you're an extra sensitive sleeper or aren't used to city night life. Being in such a prime location in the neighborhood and sharing the building with local businesses was definitely the thing that made this place unique.

Even better, Cory and Amanda's Spanish tapas restaurant was located directly downstairs, while their bar was located literally next door. During the night, the music from the bar does carry through, but they supplied us with ear plugs. We didn't even use them as we are heavy sleepers and the sound didn't bother us, but I could see how light sleepers would not like it. The apartment included a lot of amenities like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cotton swabs, floss, and toothpaste. They even had books and magazines about Seattle. There were also pots and pans to cook, although with so many great restaurants nearby, we didn't bother. Since it was my birthday celebration, Cory and Amanda had a bottle of Spanish wine waiting for me when I arrived. It goes to show how thoughtful they are!

There was an issue about a water inspection that required access to the apartment, but we were out exploring Seattle anyways and it was no big deal to me, but Amanda was so apologetic that she offered us a free (email hidden). Although it was unnecessary, I really appreciated the gesture and it shows how much they want their guests to have a great experience.

This was the perfect place for my first visit to Seattle and I will definitely be coming back. I hope I will get to stay at their place again! Thanks Cory and Amanda!"

You are just minutes away from Pike Place market and Belltown itself has great variety of places to eat, have a drink, etc. also you are very close to Olympic Park by the water which is great for jogging or taking a bike ride 2) Apartment itself is very atmospheric -  a lot of reading on the city, collection of photographs, paintings, etc. 3) check-in & check-out very smooth 4) you are next to the bar and in a very lively area - think of listening to live music from the place down the road when going to bed - for me personally it was perfect and added to the overall experience of staying in Seattle "
48522177,1707064,9/27/2015,28285196,Amanda and Cory's place was amazing! Looked exactly like the pictures and was in the perfect location for amazing food and sight seeing. It was exactly what we needed for our honeymoon!

50268333,1707064,10/11/2015,294115,"We do not have enough room to describe how much we loved this studio! The space was so charming and perfect for the two of us! The speakeasy next door was one of the absolute high lights of our trip... Great drinks, amazing atmosphere and a convenient place to start and end our evenings! The bartenders Adam, Andy, and Jonathan were so welcoming and helpful! Amanda greeted us with a smile and was helpful with any questions. The neighborhood could not be more perfect for a Seattle experience and is minutes away from bars, restaurants, pike place market and so much more! This was one of our favorite airbnb spaces ever.  We are so looking forward to our next stay! "
50528686,1707064,10/12/2015,24958118,"Perfect place to stay in the downtown area. Short walking distance from the big sights (Pikes market, space needle) and lively night life all around. The tapas bar downstairs and the bar next door were tasty and fun options for anybody looking to stay close to home. Couldn't pick a better place in downtown to stay."
50851960,1707064,10/15/2015,30144927,Cory and Amanda were wonderful hosts. They were accommodating and the check in/out process was very easy. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood - walking distance to many tourist areas and great restaurants. The Upstairs bar was great and we really enjoyed going there as well. Would definitely stay here again. 
51046100,1707064,10/17/2015,27275711,Cory and Amanda were wonderful hosts! The check-in process was seamless and they were very attentive throughout our whole stay. The apartment was very cute and the location was perfect. Next to lots of fun bars and restaurants and just a short walk to Pike's Place market. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle!
51922162,1707064,10/25/2015,6770493,"My friend and I came to Seattle for a birthday weekend trip and decided to stay in Belltown to get an ""authentic"" Seattle experience. Cory and Amanda were very helpful from the start. They emailed me suggestions for places to eat and things to do. We arrived pretty late on a Friday but one of the staff members from their restaurant let us into the apartment. (Btw, Pintxo is pretty tasty, and the upstairs bar has an awesome atmosphere and great drinks!). 

The apartment itself had everything we needed and had fun, funky decor. The bed was so comfortable that I literally took the sheets off before I left to check what mattress it was. Location of the apartment was perfect, walking distance to multiple delicious restaurants (try Local 360), shops, Pike Place Market, etc. we also walked to/from Pioneer Square a couple of times, which was a nice 30 min walk but definitely doable.

Only a few drawbacks: 
- The bar next door is loud and stays open until 2am on the weekend. The hosts provide ear plugs, and we had no trouble sleeping the one night that we did not shut the bar down ;)
- The bathroom is a bit tight, including the shower and sink area. Would definitely be hard for more than one person to get ready in the bathroom at once.

Other than that, great apartment! "
52525277,1707064,10/30/2015,6210581,"Cory and Amanda's place was wonderful! Located within walking distance to much of Seattle's sights and dining, it was the perfect place for my short two night stay. 

Their space is very comfortable and had more than enough amenities for a stay that long, including a washer/dryer, apple tv and umbrellas. 

Communication was excellent also; very timely and always courteous. 

I will definitely consider them next time I am in Seattle and highly recommend them to anyone."
53439038,1707064,11/8/2015,1101965,"We had an amazing stay with Cory and Amanda!  Communication was pretty much immediate, and always happy and pleasant.  We felt so welcome, from the very first email communication.  Once we arrived, we found the space to be so warm and comfortable, the perfect place for us.  So clean, and had everything we needed.  Location?  Amazing.  I can't say enough about our experience - overwhelmingly positive!  We can't wait to come back to Seattle, and stay right here again.   "
53658766,1707064,11/10/2015,9336316,"Great communication from the hosts before, throughout, and after our stay. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The place is beautiful. There's plenty of space for a couple. The bed is unbelievably comfortable with lots of extra pillows and blankets available. There's lots of little extras, like a magazine rack full of Seattle publications, a coffee/tea station, earplugs + white noise generator, and an AM/FM radio. And what a location! Dozens of restaurants and bars are within a couple of blocks. There's even a cozy cocktail lounge literally next door (you don't even have to leave the building)! This apartment is a great find for anyone who enjoys nightlife and wants to stay in the heart of Seattle culture."
